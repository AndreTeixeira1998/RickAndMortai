Narrator: Lisa need bracers
Narrator: Prompt By: me
Rick: Morty, we've got a mission. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, what is it this time, Rick?
Rick: We gotta help a kid get some braces, Morty.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Braces? That's it? That doesn't sound very sci-fi.
Rick: Not just any braces, Morty. We're talking about quantum braces.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Quantum braces? What the frick does that mean, Rick?
Rick: It means they can exist and not exist at the same time. Like Schr√∂dinger's cat, but for teeth.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. This sounds complicated.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! It's gonna be a blast!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Marge: Oh, hello there. You must be Rick and Morty.
Rick: That's right, Marge. We're here to help Lisa.
Marge: Well, that's very kind of you. Lisa!
[Lisa walks to Rick]
Lisa: Hi, I'm Lisa. What brings you here?
Rick: We're here to help you with your braces, kid.
Lisa: Braces? But I don't need braces.
Rick: Not yet, but you will. Trust me, kid, I've seen the future.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, Rick, are you sure about this?
Rick: Absolutely, Morty. Let's get to work.
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: Alright, Morty. Hand me that quantum wrench.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: This one, Rick?
Rick: That's the one, Morty. Now, let's get these quantum braces ready.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Alright, Morty. We've got the braces. Let's head back to the Simpsons.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Lisa: Wow, those braces look amazing! Thank you, Rick and Morty.
Rick: No problem, kid. Just remember to brush and floss.
Morty: And uh, don't eat any, uh, popcorn. It gets stuck in the braces real bad.
Rick: Good advice, Morty. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well, Morty, that was a successful mission. We helped a kid and made the multiverse a better place.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I'm just glad it's over. Can we watch some TV now?
Rick: Sure thing, Morty. But remember, adventure awaits!
