Narrator: Prompt By: Tod the sushi monster
Rick: Morty, what's with all the screaming? Did you stub your toe again?
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, I just found out that my favorite TV show got canceled!
Rick: Well, Morty, that's a real frickin' bummer. But hey, life's full of disappointments. Get used to it.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I know, Rick, but this show was everything to me. It had action, drama, and a talking dog!
Rick: Shoot, Morty, I get it. It sucks when something you love gets taken away. But maybe it's time to find a new obsession.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. It's just hard to let go, you know?
Rick: Yeah, Morty, I know. But hey, we can always create our own TV show. We've been to so many dimensions, we've got plenty of material!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Really, Rick? You think people would watch a show about us?
Rick: Hell yeah, Morty! We're the dynamic duo of interdimensional chaos. People would eat that crap up!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I don't know, Rick. It seems a bit self-indulgent.
Rick: Self-indulgent? Morty, that's what every successful TV show is. It's all about satisfying the viewers' cravings for entertainment.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. Let's give it a shot. But what would our show be about?
Rick: Well, Morty, we can call it "Rick and Morty's Multiverse Mayhem." It'll be a sci-fi comedy with a dash of existential crisis.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: That actually sounds kinda cool, Rick. But how do we even start?
Rick: Simple, Morty. We use our portal gun to travel to different dimensions and have wacky adventures. We'll make it the wildest show in the multiverse!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I like the sound of that, Rick. Let's do it! But, uh, can we make sure we don't get canceled like my favorite show?
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. We'll make sure this show stays on the air, even if we have to bribe the network executives with interdimensional goodies!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Thanks, Rick. I really appreciate it. I'm excited to see what kind of crazy stuff we'll get into on our show!
Rick: Buckle up, Morty. It's gonna be a wild ride. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Wubba lubba dub dub, Rick! Let's go create some TV magic!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Hey, Morty, before we start filming, let's see if we can find Jerry. He's gotta be somewhere in this yard.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Yeah, let's find him and show him what we're capable of. Maybe he'll finally see that we're not just a couple of screw-ups.
Rick: Ha! Good luck with that, Morty. But hey, if we find him, maybe we can make him the star of our show. That'll show him!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Yeah, maybe then he'll stop calling us idiots all the time. Let's go, Rick!
