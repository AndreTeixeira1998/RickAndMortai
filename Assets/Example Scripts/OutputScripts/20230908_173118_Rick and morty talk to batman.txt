Narrator: Rick and morty talk to batman
Narrator: Prompt By me
Rick: Morty, I have a frickin' brilliant idea.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what is it now?
Rick: We're going to meet the Batman, Morty.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Batman? You mean the comic book character?
Rick: No, Morty, the real Batman. In another dimension, he's as real as you and me.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: That sounds crazy, Rick. But also kind of cool.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty. Now grab onto your butts, we're jumping dimensions!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Back Alley]
Narrator: Rick and Morty appear in a dark, grim alley. Suddenly, a figure swoops down from above.
Batman: Who are you two? This is my city.
Rick: Calm down, Bats. We're just tourists.
[Batman walks to Rick]
Batman: Tourists? In my city? That's a new one.
Rick: Yeah, well, we're not your average tourists. We're interdimensional travelers.
[Morty walks to Batman]
Morty: Hi, Batman. I'm Morty. Big fan.
Batman: A fan, huh? Well, stay out of trouble. Gotham isn't a playground.
Rick: Don't worry, Bats. We can handle ourselves.
[Batman walks to Center Stage]
Batman: I'll be watching you.
Rick: Yeah, yeah. We get it. You're the frickin' Batman.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Morty: That was amazing, Rick! We met Batman!
Rick: Yeah, yeah. He's a real shoot and a half. But remember, Morty, we've got bigger fish to fry.
Morty: Bigger than Batman? Aww crap, Rick, what's next?
Rick: You'll see, Morty. You'll see. Wubba lubba dub dub!
