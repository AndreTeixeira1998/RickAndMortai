Narrator: rick and morty play in a band
Narrator: Prompt By: Spamus
Rick: Morty, grab your guitar! We're starting a band!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I don't know if I'm cut out for this.
Rick: Nonsense, Morty! With my musical genius and your... well, your Morty-ness, we'll be unstoppable!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Alright, Rick. But what should we call ourselves?
Rick: How about "The Interdimensional Rockers"?
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Uh, I don't know, Rick. That sounds a little cheesy.
Rick: Fine, Morty. What about "Rick and Morty's Mind Meltdown"?
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Shoot, Rick. That's even worse. How about "The Portal Punks"?
Rick: Crap, Morty. That's actually not bad. "The Portal Punks" it is!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Alright, Morty, let's start with a classic. "Smoke on the Water"!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I love that song, Rick! Let's rock it!
[Rick and Morty start playing "Smoke on the Water" on their instruments]
Rick: Frick, Morty! You're killing it on that guitar!
Morty: Thanks, Rick! You're not too bad yourself on the keyboards!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Alright, Morty, let's try something a little more challenging. "Stairway to Heaven"!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Whoa, Rick. That's a tough one. But I'll give it a shot!
[Rick and Morty start playing "Stairway to Heaven" on their instruments]
Rick: Crap, Morty! You're a natural on that guitar! Keep it up!
Morty: Thanks, Rick! You're rocking those drums like a pro!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Alright, Morty, let's show the world what we've got. Time for an original song!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Really, Rick? I don't know if I'm ready for that.
Rick: Trust me, Morty. You've got the talent. Let's call this one "Interdimensional Jam."
[Rick and Morty start playing their original song "Interdimensional Jam" on their instruments]
Rick: Frick, Morty! This song is out of this world!
Morty: Thanks, Rick! I couldn't have done it without your genius!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well, Morty, I think we've proven that we're the greatest band in the multiverse!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I never thought I'd say this, but being in a band with you is actually pretty cool.
Rick: Haha! I knew you'd come around, Morty. Now, let's go rock the universe!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Wubba lubba dub dub, Rick! Let's do it!
