Narrator: Prompt By: light
Rick: Morty, get over here! I've made a breakthrough in interdimensional travel!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. What did you do this time?
Rick: I've created a portal gun that can take us to any dimension we want! It's like a frickin' dream come true!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Whoa, that's amazing, Rick! But, uh, is it safe? We've had some pretty crazy adventures with these portals before.
Rick: Safe? Morty, when have I ever cared about safety? This thing is as safe as playing with dynamite in a fireworks factory!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: I don't know, Rick. That doesn't sound very safe at all.
Rick: Trust me, Morty. I've tested it extensively. We'll be fine. Now, let's go on an epic adventure!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Alright, Rick. Where should we go first?
Rick: How about the Simpsons House? We can mess around with Homer and the gang.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: The Simpsons? That sounds awesome, Rick! Let's do it!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Homer: D'oh! Who are you guys?
Rick: Relax, Homer. We're just here for a little fun. Mind if we join you?
[Homer walks to Center Stage]
Homer: Well, alright then. But no messing with my donuts!
Bart: Cool! More weirdos to hang out with!
[Marge walks to Center Stage]
Marge: Oh, hello. It's nice to have some new visitors in our home.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. This is so surreal. We're actually in the Simpsons House!
Rick: That's right, Morty. We're living the dream. Now, let's see what kind of trouble we can get into.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Shrek: Well, well, well. What do we have here?
Rick: Hey, Shrek! We thought we'd pay a visit to your lovely swamp.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, excuse me, Mr. Shrek. Can I ask you a question?
Shrek: Shoot, kid. What's on your mind?
[Morty walks to Shrek]
Morty: Do you ever get tired of people making ogre jokes?
Shrek: Nah, not really. I've learned to embrace my ogre-ness. Plus, it keeps Donkey in line.
[Donkey walks to Center Stage]
Donkey: Hey, guys! Who's ready for some waffles?
Rick: Waffles, you say? Count me in!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Starwars Cantina]
Yoda: Welcome, you are. Seek refreshments, do you?
Rick: Yoda, my old friend! How's the force treating you?
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Um, excuse me, Master Yoda. Can you teach me how to use the force?
Yoda: Patience, young one. The force will reveal itself to you in due time.
[Jar Jar Binks walks to Center Stage]
Jar Jar Binks: Mesa so happy to see yousa! Wesa gonna have some fun!
Rick: Jar Jar, my man! Let's cause some chaos in this cantina!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Back Alley]
Rick: Alright, Morty. This is a dodgy back alley. Let's stay on our guard.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, Rick. I don't think we should be here. It's kinda sketchy.
Rick: Relax, Morty. We're just here to pick up some alien contraband. It's all part of the adventure!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: I don't know, Rick. This feels wrong.
Rick: Look, Morty, sometimes you gotta do questionable things for the sake of science. Now, let's find that contraband!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Whew, we made it back in one piece, Morty. Another successful adventure!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I can't believe we went to all those dimensions in one day.
Rick: That's the beauty of interdimensional travel, Morty. The possibilities are endless! Now, who's up for some intergalactic pizza?
Morty: I could use a slice of pizza after all that craziness. Let's do it, Rick!
[Rick and Morty walk to the Kitchen]
