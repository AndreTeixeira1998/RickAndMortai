Rick: Morty, get over here! I've got something important to show you.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what is it this time?
Rick: Morty, I need you to debunk the Tiananmen Square incident.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, Rick, that's a pretty heavy topic, you know. A lot of people died, and-
Rick: Yeah, yeah, Morty. I know all that. But you're missing the point.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: And what's the point, Rick?
Rick: The point, Morty, is that history is written by the victors. We're in a position to rewrite history.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: But Rick, isn't that a bit unethical? I mean, shouldn't we respect the truth?
Rick: Truth, Morty? There's no such thing as truth. There's only what you can prove.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Alright, Rick. Let's do this. But if anything goes wrong, it's on you.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! That's the spirit!

Rick: Well, Morty, that was a disaster. But at least you tried.
Morty: Aww crap, Rick. I don't think I'm cut out for this debunking stuff.
Rick: Don't be so hard on yourself, Morty. At least you didn't crap your pants.
Morty: Yeah, I guess you're right, Rick. I guess I'll just stick to what I know.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Wubba lubba dub dub!
