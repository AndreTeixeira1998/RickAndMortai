Narrator: Rick and morty talk to the narrator
Narrator: Prompt By: JoeTheWiltshire
Rick: Alright, Morty, listen up. We've been through some crazy adventures, but this time, let's break the fourth wall!

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Break the fourth wall, Rick? What are you talking about?

Rick: I'm talking about talking to the narrator, Morty. We're gonna have a little chat with the person controlling our every move.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Are you serious, Rick? That's, like, meta and stuff. Can we even do that?

Rick: Of course we can, Morty. We're the main characters, the stars of the show. We can do whatever the frick we want!

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Well, okay, Rick. If you say so. Hey, narrator! Yeah, you! We wanna have a word with you!

[Narrator: Rick and Morty address the narrator]

Rick: Look, narrator, we know you're pulling the strings here. But we just wanna have a little chat, ya know? Shoot the crap, if you will.

Morty: Yeah, we're the ones going through all these dimensions and crazy adventures. Can't we have a say in what happens?

Rick: Exactly, Morty! We're not just puppets in your little story. We're real, complex characters with thoughts and feelings.

Morty: And we've got some questions too. Like, why do we always end up in these life-threatening situations? Can't we have a nice, relaxing day once in a while?

Rick: Yeah, and what's with all the profanity? We can't even say the word "f*ck" on TV, but we're allowed to say "frick" and "crap" all the time? That's just messed up.

Morty: And why do we always have to go to different dimensions? Can't we just stay home and watch Interdimensional Cable?

Rick: Morty, we've been over this. Interdimensional Cable is, like, the lowest form of entertainment. We need to keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. But it would be nice to have a little more control over our own destinies.

Rick: Well, Morty, that's the price we pay for being the stars of the show. We're at the mercy of the writers and the audience.

Morty: Yeah, but sometimes I just wanna say "screw you" to the audience and do my own thing.

Rick: Morty, we can't just say "screw you" to the audience. They're the ones who make our adventures possible. Without them, we're nothing.

Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. I just wish we had a little more say in our own lives, ya know?

Rick: I hear you, Morty. But for now, let's just keep doing what we do best: going on crazy adventures, making meta jokes, and breaking the fourth wall.

Morty: Yeah, I guess that's what we signed up for. But hey, narrator, if you're listening, can you at least give us a heads up before throwing us into another dangerous situation?

Rick: Yeah, a little warning would be nice. We're not invincible, you know. We're just a couple of regular guys trying to survive in a multiverse of chaos.

Morty: So, narrator, what do you say? Can we have a little more control over our own destinies? Can we have a say in what happens next?

Rick: Or are we just doomed to be pawns in your storytelling game?

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Well, Rick, I guess we'll just have to wait and see. In the meantime, let's go on another crazy adventure and see where it takes us.

[Rick walks to Morty]

Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Wubba lubba dub dub! Let's show the narrator what we're made of!

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Yeah, narrator, we're ready for whatever you throw at us. Just remember, we're not just characters. We're Rick and Morty!
