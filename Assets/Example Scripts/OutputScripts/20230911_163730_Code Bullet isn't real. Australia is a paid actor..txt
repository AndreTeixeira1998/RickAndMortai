Narrator: Prompt By: JamesTK
Rick: Morty, I've made a groundbreaking discovery!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what is it this time?
Rick: You won't believe it, Morty. Code Bullet isn't real. He's just a paid actor from Australia!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: What? Are you serious, Rick? I've been watching his videos for years!
Rick: Yeah, Morty, it's all a sham. Australia is in on it. They're paying this guy to make it seem like AI is advancing at an incredible rate.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: That's insane, Rick! So, all those videos of AI playing games and solving puzzles are just fake?
Rick: Yup, Morty. It's all smoke and mirrors. They're using advanced algorithms and pre-recorded gameplay to make it look like AI is doing amazing things.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Shoot, Rick. I feel so betrayed. I thought Code Bullet was pushing the boundaries of AI.
Rick: Don't beat yourself up, Morty. It's easy to get caught up in the hype. But now we know the truth. It's all crap.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: So, what do we do now, Rick? Do we expose this conspiracy?
Rick: Nah, Morty. Let's just enjoy the show. It's like watching a magic trick. Once you know how it's done, it's still entertaining to see it in action.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. It's just disappointing to realize that something you believed in was all a frickin' lie.
Rick: Welcome to the real world, Morty. It's full of deception and hidden agendas. But hey, at least we have each other to navigate through this crap.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Yeah, Rick. I'm glad I have you by my side. Even if everything else turns out to be fake, our adventures are real, right?
Rick: Absolutely, Morty. Our adventures are as real as it gets. So, let's keep exploring the multiverse and finding the truth, even if it's a little messed up.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Alright, Rick. Let's keep doing what we do best. Wubba lubba dub dub!
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Now, let's go create some chaos and show the world what real AI can do!
