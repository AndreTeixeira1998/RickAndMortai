Narrator: Morty tries to stop Rick from overthrowing the Italian government
Narrator: Prompt By: Grumulon Games
Rick: Morty, I've got a plan!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, re-really Rick? What's the plan this time?
Rick: We're going to overthrow the Italian government, Morty!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick! That sounds like a lot of trouble!
Rick: Nah, Morty, it'll be easy. We just need to get to the Prime Minister's office and replace him with a clone.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, Rick, isn't that, like, illegal?
Rick: Only if we get caught, Morty, only if we get caught.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Aww man, Rick, this sounds like a bad idea. Are you sure about this?
Rick: Absolutely, Morty. Trust me, it's for the greater good!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Alright, Rick. But if anything goes wrong, I'm blaming you.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! Let's get this show on the road!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Back Alley]
Rick: Here we are, Morty. The back alley of the Prime Minister's office.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: This place smells like crap, Rick. Are you sure we're in the right place?
Rick: Positive, Morty. Now, let's go find that clone.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww man, Rick. This is a bad idea. We should just go home.
Rick: No way, Morty! We're in this too deep now. Let's go!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Alright, Morty. We've got the clone. Now all we need to do is replace the Prime Minister.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: I still think this is a bad idea, Rick. We're going to get in so much trouble.
Rick: Relax, Morty. It's all under control. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I hope you know what you're doing.
Rick: Trust me, Morty. I always know what I'm doing.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Back Alley]
Narrator: Rick and Morty successfully replace the Prime Minister with the clone and make their escape.
Rick: See, Morty? I told you it would be easy.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I can't believe we just did that.
Rick: Believe it, Morty! We just made history!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Morty: Well, Rick, I hope you're right about this.
Rick: I always am, Morty. I always am.
