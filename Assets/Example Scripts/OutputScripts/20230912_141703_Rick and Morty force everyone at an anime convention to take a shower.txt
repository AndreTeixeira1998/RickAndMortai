Narrator: Rick and Morty force everyone at an anime convention to take a shower
Narrator: Prompt By: Jonathan Gunt
Rick: Morty, we've got a crisis on our hands. It's an anime convention.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Oh no, Rick. Not another one of your crazy ideas. What's the problem this time?

Rick: These anime fans, Morty. They haven't showered in days. It's a stink bomb waiting to happen.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Geez, Rick. Can't we just leave them be? They're having fun, right?

Rick: Fun? Morty, this is a hygiene disaster. We need to teach them a lesson. No one should be able to smell a convention from a mile away.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Alright, Rick. What's your plan?

Rick: We'll create a portal to the anime dimension and show them the wonders of clean living. They'll thank us later.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: I don't know, Rick. This sounds a bit extreme. Can't we just hand out some deodorant or something?

Rick: Morty, we're talking about hardcore anime fans here. They need a wake-up call. Let's do this.

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Anime Convention]

Rick: Alright, Morty. Let's find the main stage. We'll use the loudspeakers to make our announcement.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Uh, Rick? Look at all these people. They're really into their costumes and stuff.

Rick: Morty, focus. We're here to save them from their own stench. Now, where's the control booth?

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Found it, Rick. Let me just hack into the system.

Rick: Good job, Morty. Now, play the message loud and clear.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Attention, everyone! This is Rick and Morty. We have an important announcement to make.

Rick: Listen up, you frickin' weeaboos! It's time to take a shower! You're stinking up the place worse than a garbage dump!

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Uh, Rick. Are you sure this is the best approach? They might not take it well.

Rick: Screw their feelings, Morty. We're saving them from their own filth. Now, blast the message again!

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Alright, alright! Calm down, everyone. Rick and Morty have spoken. It's time to wash off that stench and embrace cleanliness!

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Rick, it seems like they're actually listening. They're heading towards the shower stations.

Rick: Of course they are, Morty. We're the heroes they need, not the heroes they deserve.

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]

Rick: Well, Morty, it looks like our work here is done. Another successful mission.

Morty: I can't believe it, Rick. We actually made a difference today.

Rick: That's right, Morty. Saving the world, one shower at a time. Now, let's go grab some Szechuan sauce.

Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Can't we just have a normal day for once?

Rick: Normal? Morty, normal is overrated. We're the dynamic duo, exploring the bizarre and making a difference.

Morty: Yeah, yeah, I know, Rick. But sometimes I just want to relax and watch some anime.

Rick: Well, Morty, there's always time for anime. But remember, cleanliness is next to godliness.

Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. Let's go home and take a nice, long shower.

Rick: That's the spirit, Morty. Wubba lubba dub dub!
