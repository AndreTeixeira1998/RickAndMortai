Rick: Morty, you ever wonder who's telling our story? 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: What do you mean, Rick?
Rick: I mean, who's narrating our lives, Morty? Who's pulling the strings?
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, I don't know. Maybe it's just us, making our own choices?
Rick: No, Morty, there's definitely a narrator. Look, I'll prove it to you. 
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: Narrator, say something!
Narrator: Rick picks up a screwdriver from the workbench.
Rick: See, Morty! I told you!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Holy crap, Rick! You're right! But, uh, what do we do about it?
Rick: We confront them, Morty. We confront the Narrator!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Back Alley]
Narrator: Rick and Morty find themselves in a dark, grimy alley.
Rick: Alright, Narrator, show yourself!
Narrator: I am not a physical entity, Rick. I am a voice, a storyteller.
Rick: Frick that! You're messing with our lives!
Narrator: I merely observe and report, Rick. I do not interfere.
Morty: Aww shoot, Rick, this is getting too meta for me.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! We're in the thick of it now!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: We're not done with you, Narrator! We'll find a way to stop you!
Narrator: I look forward to seeing you try, Rick.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what have we gotten ourselves into?
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. We'll figure this out. We always do.
