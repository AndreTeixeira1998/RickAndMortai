Narrator: Morty walks to the workbench
Narrator: Prompt By: PROPLAYEN
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Alright, Rick, what do we have here on the workbench?
Rick: Morty, I've been working on a new invention. It's a device that can turn any object into a weapon.
Morty: Uh, Rick, isn't that a little dangerous?
Rick: Morty, danger is my middle name. Actually, it's Sanchez, but you get the point.
Morty: Alright, Rick. So, how does this weaponizer thing work?
Rick: It's quite simple, Morty. You just place the object you want to turn into a weapon on the workbench, press this button, and bam! You have a fully functional weapon.
Morty: That sounds pretty cool, Rick. But, uh, what if we accidentally turn something harmless into a deadly weapon?
Rick: Morty, I'm a genius. I've programmed the weaponizer to only work on objects that are already potential weapons.
Morty: Oh, okay, that's a relief. So, what can we weaponize?
Rick: Well, Morty, the possibilities are endless. We can turn a spoon into a deadly dagger, a rubber duck into a flamethrower, or even a frickin' toothpick into a laser gun.
Morty: Shoot, Rick! That's insane! But, uh, why do we need all these weapons?
Rick: Morty, we live in a crazy multiverse where danger lurks around every corner. It's always better to be prepared, even if it means turning harmless objects into deadly tools.
Morty: I guess you have a point, Rick. But, uh, what if we accidentally shoot ourselves or something?
Rick: Morty, trust me, I've made sure the weaponizer has built-in safety measures. It won't fire unless it's aimed away from us.
Morty: Okay, I'll take your word for it, Rick. But, uh, can we at least test it out somewhere safe?
Rick: Of course, Morty. Let's head to the backyard and test it out on some old junk. Just make sure to stay behind me, okay?
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Morty: Man, Rick, this place is a mess. What do you want to weaponize first?
Rick: How about that broken lawnmower over there? It'll make a perfect target.
Morty: Alright, Rick, let's do this. I'll place the lawnmower on the workbench.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Okay, Rick, lawnmower's on the workbench. Get ready.
Rick: Frick yeah, Morty! Let's turn this junk into a deadly weapon!
[Rick presses the button on the weaponizer, and the lawnmower transforms into a rocket launcher]
Morty: Holy crap, Rick! It worked! We have a frickin' rocket launcher now!
Rick: That's right, Morty! Now, let's see what this baby can do. Aim for that tree over there.
[Morty takes aim with the rocket launcher and fires, causing a massive explosion]
Morty: Whoa, Rick! That was amazing! This weaponizer thing is the real deal!
Rick: I told you, Morty. I'm a genius. Now, let's see what else we can turn into weapons. How about that rusty bike?
Morty: Sure thing, Rick. Let's weaponize that crap out of it!
[Rick and Morty continue to experiment with the weaponizer, turning various objects into deadly weapons. They laugh and have a blast, embracing the chaotic nature of their adventures.]
