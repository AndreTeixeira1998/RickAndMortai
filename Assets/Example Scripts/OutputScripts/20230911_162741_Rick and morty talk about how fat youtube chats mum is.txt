Narrator: Rick and morty talk about how fat youtube chats mum is
Narrator: Prompt By: me
Rick: Morty, have you seen the latest video on YouTube?

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Uh, no, Rick. What's it about?

Rick: It's a live stream of a cooking show, Morty. And let me tell ya, the comments section is going wild!

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Oh boy, here we go. What are they saying this time, Rick?

Rick: Well, Morty, they're roasting the chef's mom. They keep saying she's so fat that she uses the oven as a hot tub!

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Oh man, that's harsh. Can't they just appreciate the cooking?

Rick: Morty, have you ever been on the internet? It's a cesspool of insults and trolls. It's like a breeding ground for idiots.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Yeah, but still, making fun of someone's mom is just mean.

Rick: Mean? Morty, we're talking about YouTube comments here. They're as meaningless as the plot of a Michael Bay movie.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. But it's still messed up.

Rick: Look, Morty, people on the internet hide behind their screens and say things they'd never have the guts to say in real life. It's all just a digital power trip.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Yeah, I get it. But it's just sad to see how low people can go.

Rick: Morty, the internet is a reflection of humanity's worst traits. It's a reminder that no matter how advanced we become, we're still a bunch of idiots.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: I know, Rick. It's just frustrating sometimes.

Rick: Well, Morty, the best thing you can do is not let it get to you. Don't give those trolls the satisfaction.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Yeah, you're right, Rick. I shouldn't let their words affect me.

Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Now, let's get back to our adventures and leave the YouTube comments where they belong - in the digital trash can.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Alright, Rick. But can we at least block those trolls?

Rick: Morty, blocking them won't solve anything. They'll just come back with new accounts. Just ignore them and focus on what really matters.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Fine, Rick. But if I see any more fat jokes, I'm gonna lose it.

Rick: Trust me, Morty, they're not worth your time. Let's go explore some dimensions where people have better things to do than insult each other's moms.

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]

Rick: Frick, Morty, we just went outside our house.

Morty: Crap, this is still our dimension. But at least we're away from those YouTube trolls.

Rick: Shoot, Morty, you're right. Let's make the most of it and find something interesting to do.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Yeah, let's forget about those losers and have our own adventure.

Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Wubba lubba dub dub!

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Wubba lubba dub dub, Rick! Let's go find some interdimensional trouble!
