Narrator: [Morty explains why he is into femboys]
Narrator: Prompt By: Ihor Yashchenko
Rick: Morty, get over here! I've found something interesting.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what is it this time?
Rick: Well, Morty, it's not exactly a thing. It's more of a concept.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, Rick, I don't really get it. What are you talking about?
Rick: I'm talking about your Internet search history, Morty.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: My what now? Rick, did you invade my privacy again?
Rick: Well, Morty, it's not exactly invading if it's for scientific research, right?
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, Rick, I think that's exactly what invading privacy means. But, uh, what did you find?
Rick: Well, Morty, I found that you have a certain... fascination with femboys.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, uh, Rick, I can explain...
Rick: No need to explain, Morty. I'm not here to judge. I'm just curious.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Well, Rick, I guess I just find them attractive. They're cute, and they have a certain charm to them. It's not something I can really explain.
Rick: Well, Morty, that's completely fine. Everyone has their own preferences. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Thanks, Rick. I appreciate your understanding. But, uh, can we keep this between us?
Rick: Sure thing, Morty. Your secret is safe with me.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Thanks, Rick. You're not so bad, you know.
Rick: Thanks, Morty. I try my best.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: So, Rick, what's the next adventure? 
Rick: Well, Morty, I'm thinking we could pay a visit to Shrek's Swamp. 
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Shrek: What are you doing in my swamp?
Morty: Aww, crap, Rick. Not this guy again.
Rick: Relax, Morty. We're just here for a quick visit.
