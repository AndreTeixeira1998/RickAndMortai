Narrator: Shrek and Yoda argue over who's the better green character
Narrator: Prompt By: Joe Sean A G
Rick: Morty, I've got a little experiment I want to try out. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh uh, what kind of experiment, Rick?
Rick: I want to find out who's the better green character, Shrek or Yoda.
Morty: You mean, like, who would win in a fight or something?
Rick: Exactly, Morty. We'll take them out of their comfort zones and let them argue it out.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, isn't that a bit... dangerous?
Rick: Dangerous? Morty, this is science! Let's get this show on the road.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Rick: Shrek, we need your help. We're having a debate and we need you to argue why you're the better green character. 
Shrek: What? Who am I arguing against?
Rick: Yoda from Star Wars. 
Shrek: Star Wars? Never heard of it. But I'm always up for a good argument.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Starwars Cantina]
Rick: Yoda, we need your help. We're having a debate and we need you to argue why you're the better green character.
Yoda: Hmm, better than who, am I?
Rick: Shrek from Shrek.
Yoda: Shrek? Not familiar with him, I am. But argue, I can.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Alright, Morty, let's bring them both here and let them argue it out. 
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Rick: Shrek, step through this portal. We're going to have a little debate.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Starwars Cantina]
Rick: Yoda, step through this portal. We're going to have a little debate.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Shrek: Who's this little green guy? 
Yoda: Hmm, larger than me, you are. But size matters not. 
Shrek: Size matters not? Have you seen the size of my frickin' castle?
Yoda: Castle, you may have. But wisdom, I possess. 
Shrek: Wisdom? You're just a bunch of riddles and sayings. I've got a heart and a story.
Yoda: A story, you may have. But the Force, I have. 
Shrek: The Force? What's that, some kind of magic trick? I've got real magic, not some space mumbo-jumbo.
Yoda: Mumbo-jumbo, you call it. But understand it, you do not. The Force is life.
Shrek: Life? I've got life. I've got a wife and kids and a whole kingdom of life.
Yoda: Hmm, a kingdom, you have. But peace, I bring. 
Shrek: Peace? I've got peace! After I kick out all those frickin' fairy tale creatures.
Rick: Alright, Morty, I think we've heard enough. Who do you think won?
Morty: Uh uh, I don't know, Rick. They both made some good points.
Rick: Well, Morty, that's the beauty of debates. There's no right or wrong answer. Just different perspectives.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, you're getting all philosophical on me.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! It's all in a day's work.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Rick: Thanks for your time, Shrek. You can go back to your swamp now.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Starwars Cantina]
Rick: Thanks for your time, Yoda. You can go back to your cantina now.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well, Morty, I think that was a successful experiment. 
Morty: I guess so, Rick. But I think I need a break from all this debating.
Rick: Fair enough, Morty. Let's call it a day.
