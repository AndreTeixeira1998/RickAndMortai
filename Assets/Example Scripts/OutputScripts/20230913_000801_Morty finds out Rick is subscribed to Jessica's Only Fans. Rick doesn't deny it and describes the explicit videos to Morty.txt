Narrator: Morty finds out Rick is subscribed to Jessica's Only Fans. Rick doesn't deny it and describes the explicit videos to Morty
Narrator: Prompt By: StewartW12
Rick: Morty, there's something I need to show you.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, sure Rick, what is it?
Rick: I've subscribed to Jessica's Only Fans.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: What!? Are you fricking kidding me, Rick? That's Jessica, my classmate, Rick!
Rick: Yes, Morty, I am well aware of who Jessica is. But have you seen her content? It's quite... enlightening. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Enlightening? Rick, that's just creepy and wrong on so many levels! 
Rick: Oh, lighten up, Morty. It's not like I'm stalking her. I'm just appreciating the content she's chosen to share with the world.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I can't believe you're doing this. Jessica is a person, not just some content for you to consume.
Rick: And she's making a living out of it, Morty. You should be proud of her entrepreneurial spirit.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: I don't think I can look at you the same way again, Rick.
Rick: Oh shoot, Morty. Don't be such a drama queen. It's not like I'm the only one subscribed to her account.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: That doesn't make it any better, Rick! It's just... it's just crap, Rick!
Rick: Well, Morty, you're entitled to your own opinion. But remember, one man's crap is another man's treasure.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: You're fricked up, Rick. This is just... this is just too much.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! Life is full of surprises, isn't it?
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Yeah, and some of them are just... just really messed up, Rick.
Rick: Well, Morty, that's life. You never know what you're gonna get.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I just... I just can't believe this.
Rick: Believe it, Morty. And remember, this is just the tip of the iceberg.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I don't even want to know what that means, Rick.
