Narrator: Rick and Homer and Yoda make a diss track on CodeBullet
Narrator: Prompt By: Sally Trip
Rick: Morty, we're going on an adventure!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. What kind of adventure is it this time?
Rick: We're going to make a diss track, Morty. And we're gonna need some help.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Homer: D'oh, who are you guys?
Rick: Homer, we need your help. We're making a diss track.
Homer: A diss track? Count me in! Who are we dissing?
Rick: We're dissing CodeBullet, Homer.
Homer: CodeBullet, huh? Sounds like a real piece of work.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, Rick, shouldn't we get some more help?
Rick: Good idea, Morty. Let's get one more person.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Starwars Cantina]
Yoda: Hmm, visitors, we have.
Rick: Yoda, we need your help. We're making a diss track.
Yoda: A diss track, you say? Interesting, this is.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Alright, we've got our team. Let's get this thing started.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Alright, let's get started. Homer, you're up first.
Homer: CodeBullet, you're nothing but a hack. You couldn't code your way out of a paper sack!
Rick: Nice one, Homer. Yoda, your turn.
Yoda: CodeBullet, weak your coding is. Even Jar Jar Binks, better than you, he is.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. This is getting brutal.
Rick: That's the point, Morty. Now, it's my turn. CodeBullet, you're a real piece of crap. Your code is so bad, it makes me want to nap.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. You really went in on him.
Rick: That's how you make a diss track, Morty. Wubba lubba dub dub!
Morty: Uh, I guess that's one way to do it, Rick.
Rick: Now, let's get this track out there. CodeBullet won't know what hit him!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Uh, Rick, do you think we went too far?
Rick: No way, Morty. This is just the beginning.
