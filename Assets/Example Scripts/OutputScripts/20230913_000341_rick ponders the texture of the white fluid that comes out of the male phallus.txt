Narrator: rick ponders the texture of the white fluid that comes out of the male phallus
Narrator: Prompt By: Jake Warner
Rick: Morty, have you ever wondered about the properties of, uh, human semen?
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, uh, Rick, that's a bit weird, isn't it?
Rick: It's science, Morty! I mean, the stuff is full of proteins, enzymes, even some fructose! 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, I don't think I want to know about this.
Rick: Fine, Morty, but the mysteries of life are often found in the most unexpected places.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, Rick, can we talk about something else?
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: Alright, Morty, let's shift gears. Ever wondered about the mysteries of the universe?
Morty: That sounds a bit better, Rick.
Rick: Good, because I've been working on a new device. It's a quantum energy detector!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Quantum energy detector? What does that do, Rick?
Rick: Well, Morty, it can detect energy fluctuations in the quantum realm. It's like a Geiger counter, but for subatomic particles.
Morty: So, uh, what does that mean, Rick?
Rick: It means, Morty, that we can detect changes in the quantum field. Like when someone opens a portal to another dimension.
Morty: That sounds pretty cool, Rick. But, uh, is it safe?
Rick: Safe? Morty, we're dealing with quantum physics here. Nothing is safe! 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, you're not making me feel any better.
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. I'll be right there with you. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Alright, Rick, let's give it a try. But if anything goes wrong, it's on you.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Okay Morty, let's test this thing out.
Morty: I hope this doesn't turn out like last time, Rick.
Rick: Relax, Morty. What could possibly go wrong?
Morty: That's what you said last time, Rick. And then we almost got eaten by a space worm!
Rick: Yeah, well, we're not in space now, Morty. We're in our own backyard. Now, let's get to work.
