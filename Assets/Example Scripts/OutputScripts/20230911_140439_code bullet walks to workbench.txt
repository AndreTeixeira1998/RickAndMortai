Rick: Hey Morty, check this out. I've been working on a new invention.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. What is it this time?
Rick: It's a virtual reality simulator, Morty. With this, we can create our own video games and explore new dimensions without leaving the garage!
Morty: Whoa, that sounds pretty cool, Rick. How does it work?
Rick: Well, Morty, you just put on this headset and it'll transport you to a whole new world. It's like living in a video game!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Shoot, Rick. That's amazing! Can I try it out?
Rick: Of course, Morty. Just be careful, it's still in beta testing.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Thanks, Rick. I'll make sure to be careful.
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: Alright, Morty, put on the headset and let's see what you got.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Here goes nothing, Rick!

Homer: D'oh! Who are you guys?
Rick: We're just visiting, Homer. Don't mind us.
Bart: Cool! Are you guys from another dimension?
Morty: Yeah, we're from another dimension. We came to check out your world.
Marge: Well, welcome to Springfield, boys. Would you like some donuts?
Rick: Donuts? Now you're speaking my language, Marge.
[Rick walks to Center Stage]
Homer: Woo-hoo! Donuts for everyone!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. This dimension is crazy.
Rick: You haven't seen anything yet, Morty. Just wait till we visit Shrek's Swamp.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Shrek's Swamp? Are you serious, Rick?
Rick: Oh, it's gonna be great, Morty. Shrek and Donkey are some of the most interesting characters out there.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Shrek: Well, well, well. Who do we have here?
Donkey: Hey, look, Shrek. It's some weird-looking humans.
Rick: We're not just weird-looking, Donkey. We're interdimensional travelers.
Morty: Yeah, we're here to see what your swamp is all about.
Shrek: Well, if you're looking for adventure, you've come to the right place. Welcome to my swamp!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. This is getting weirder and weirder.
Rick: That's the beauty of it, Morty. Embrace the weirdness.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. Let's see what other dimensions we can explore.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty. Adventure awaits us. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Yeah, yeah, adventure. But can we grab some burgers first?
Rick: Burgers? Now you're talking my language, Morty. Let's go find a dimension with the best burgers in the multiverse.
