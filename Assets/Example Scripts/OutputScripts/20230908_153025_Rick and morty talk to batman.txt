Rick: Morty, get your butt over here, I've got a new gadget I want you to try out. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Oh man, Rick, is that a Bat-signal? 
Rick: You're darn right it is, Morty. I've modified it to call on a very special guest. 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: A special guest? Who could be more special than us, Rick?
Rick: Oh, you'd be surprised, Morty. You'd be very surprised. 
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: Alright, Morty, stand back. This could get a little messy.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Back Alley]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. This place is kind of creepy.
Rick: Hold on to your pants, Morty. We're not alone here.
Batman: Who dares summon the Dark Knight?
Rick: Hey there, Batsy. We just needed a hand with something.
Batman: This better be important, Rick.
Morty: Oh crap, it's actually Batman!
Rick: Cool your jets, Morty. He's just a guy in a bat costume. 
Batman: I am more than a man in a bat costume. 
Rick: Sure, sure, Batsy. Now, about that favor. We need to borrow your Batmobile.
Batman: You must be joking, Rick.
Rick: Do I look like the Joker to you, Batman? 
Batman: You're not getting my Batmobile, Rick.
Morty: Aww shoot, Rick. Now what are we going to do?
Rick: No worries, Morty. I've got a backup plan. 
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: See Morty, always have a backup plan. 
Morty: Yeah, Rick. A backup plan to annoy Batman. Real smart.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! 
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick.
