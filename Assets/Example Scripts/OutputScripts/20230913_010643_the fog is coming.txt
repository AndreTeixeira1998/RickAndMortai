Narrator: the fog is coming
Narrator: Prompt By: The Cat Brat
Rick: Morty, we need to prepare!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, uh, prepare for what, Rick?
Rick: The fog, Morty! The interdimensional fog is coming!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Interdimensional fog? What the heck is that, Rick?
Rick: It's a fog that seeps through the cracks of the multiverse, Morty. It can cause all sorts of weird stuff to happen!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Like what, Rick?
Rick: Like us ending up in Shrek's swamp, Morty. Or worse, the Simpsons' house!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, that sounds bad. How do we stop it?
Rick: We can't stop it, Morty. We can only prepare. 
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: We need to gather our gear and get ready to jump dimensions.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: But, Rick, I have school tomorrow. I can't miss another day.
Rick: School? With the interdimensional fog coming? You're joking, right?
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: No, I'm not joking, Rick. I have a test tomorrow!
Rick: Morty, this is more important than your test. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww, crap, Rick. Okay, let's do this.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Shrek: What are you doing in my swamp?
Rick: Frick, Shrek, we don't have time for this. The interdimensional fog is coming!
Shrek: The what now?
Donkey: Sounds scary, Shrek. Maybe we should help them.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Homer: Mmm... interdimensional fog. Is it edible?
Marge: Homer! We need to help them.
Rick: Thanks, Marge. We need all the help we can get.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well, Morty, we've warned everyone we can. Now, we wait.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I hope we're ready for this.
Rick: We're as ready as we'll ever be, Morty. Now, let's get some rest.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Okay, Rick. Goodnight.
Rick: Goodnight, Morty. Wubba lubba dub dub!
