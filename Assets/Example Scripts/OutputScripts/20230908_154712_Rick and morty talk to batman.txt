Rick: Morty, come here, I've got a surprise for you!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez Rick, what is it this time?
Rick: We're going on a little trip Morty, a trip to Gotham.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Gotham? You mean like Batman Gotham? 
Rick: That's right, Morty. We're going to meet the Bat himself.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Back Alley]

Narrator: Rick and Morty emerge from the portal into a dark, grim alleyway in Gotham City.

Morty: Holy crap Rick, we're really in Gotham!
Rick: Keep your voice down, Morty. We don't want to attract any unwanted attention.
Batman: Too late for that.
[Rick and Morty turn to Batman]
Morty: Oh shoot! It's Batman!
Batman: I heard you two from a mile away. What are you doing in my city?
Rick: Relax, Batboy. We're just here for a little sightseeing. 
Batman: Sightseeing? In a back alley? Doesn't seem right.
Morty: Well, we're not exactly normal tourists.
Rick: That's right, Morty. We're on a different level.
Batman: I've dealt with your kind before. Interdimensional travellers causing chaos.
Rick: Chaos? Us? Nah, we're just here for the fun. Right, Morty?
Morty: Yeah, fun. That's us. Fun seekers.
Batman: Just remember, I'm watching you two. Don't cause any trouble.
Rick: You got it, Batboy. We're just here to enjoy the sights. 
Batman: It's Batman.
Rick: Sure, Batboy. Whatever you say.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. We better not mess this up.
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Morty: That was intense, Rick. Batman is really intimidating.
Rick: He's just a man in a bat suit, Morty. Nothing to be scared of.
Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. But still, let's not go back there anytime soon.
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. We've got other adventures to go on.
