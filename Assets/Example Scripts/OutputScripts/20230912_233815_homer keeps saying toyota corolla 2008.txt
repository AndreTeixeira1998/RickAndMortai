Rick: Morty, we've got a new mission. We're going to the Simpsons' dimension.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, the Simpsons? Aww jeez, Rick.
Rick: That's right, Morty. We're going to figure out why Homer keeps saying "Toyota Corolla 2008."
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Why the frick would we care about that, Rick?
Rick: Because Morty, it might be a code or something. You never know. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Alright, Rick. Let's do this.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Homer: Toyota Corolla 2008! Toyota Corolla 2008!
Rick: There he goes again. Morty, keep your eyes peeled for anything unusual.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, Rick, isn't this whole thing unusual?
Rick: Shut up, Morty.
Bart: Hey, aren't you the guys from that weird sci-fi show?
Rick: That's right, kid. We're here to find out why your dad keeps saying "Toyota Corolla 2008."
Bart: Oh, that's easy. He's trying to win a radio contest. First one to say "Toyota Corolla 2008" a hundred times wins a new car.
Rick: A radio contest? That's it? Morty, let's get out of here.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I thought it was going to be something cool.
Rick: Sometimes, Morty, the most mundane explanations are the right ones.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well Morty, that was a shoot waste of time. 
Morty: Yeah, Rick. I guess not every adventure can be exciting.
Rick: That's right, Morty. But remember, even the most boring adventures can teach us something.
Morty: Yeah, like not to waste our time on stupid radio contests.
Rick: Exactly, Morty. Wubba lubba dub dub!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. You're such a goofball.
