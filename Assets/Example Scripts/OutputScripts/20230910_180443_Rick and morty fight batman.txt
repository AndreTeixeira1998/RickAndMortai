Narrator: Rick and morty fight batman
Narrator: Prompt By: me
Rick: Morty, get your sorry ass over here! We've got company!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick! Who's causing trouble now?
Rick: It's none other than the Dark Knight himself, Batman!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Holy crap, Rick! Batman? What did we do to piss him off?
Rick: I have no idea, Morty. Maybe he's just jealous of our superior intelligence and interdimensional adventures.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Well, we better be ready, Rick. I don't think we stand a chance against Batman.
Rick: Nonsense, Morty! With my scientific genius and your...uh...Morty-ness, we can take on anyone!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Alright, Rick. What's the plan?
Rick: We'll use our portal gun to create a distraction, Morty. While Batman is busy dealing with that, we'll attack from behind.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Sounds risky, Rick. But I trust you. Let's do this!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Alright, Morty. Get ready to frickin' rumble!
Morty: Here goes nothing, Rick!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Morty, look! It's Batman!
Morty: Holy crap, he's fast!
Rick: Quick, Morty! Shoot him with the freeze ray!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: I'm on it, Rick!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Freeze, Batman!
Batman: You think a little freeze gun can stop me, Morty?
Rick: Morty, watch out!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, he got me!
Rick: Not so fast, Batman! Take this!
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: Prepare to be electrocuted, you frickin' bat!
Batman: You think your gadgets can match my skills, Rick?
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Rick, I'm coming back for round two!
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Let's show Batman what we're made of!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: I've got an idea, Rick. Let's use the portal gun to trap Batman in another dimension!
Rick: Brilliant, Morty! Shoot the portal at his feet!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Take this, Batman!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Back Alley]
Batman: What the crap? Where am I?
Rick: Welcome to the back alley, Batman. You're a long way from Gotham now.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Looks like we won, Rick!
Rick: We sure did, Morty. Another victory for the dynamic duo of science and stupidity!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I can't believe we just took down Batman.
Rick: Well, Morty, when you mess with the smartest guys in the multiverse, you're bound to get your ass kicked.
Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. Let's go celebrate with some interdimensional pizza!
Rick: Now you're talking, Morty! Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Wubba lubba dub dub, Rick! Let's go get some pizza!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
