Narrator: Rick and morty fight batman
Narrator: Prompt By: me
Rick: Morty, get your butt in here! I've got a new adventure for us.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. What is it this time?
Rick: We're going to have a little showdown with the Dark Knight himself, Batman!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Batman? Seriously, Rick? Isn't he, like, a superhero or something?
Rick: Yeah, Morty, but he's also a total buzzkill. I want to see if we can outsmart him.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Outsmart Batman? That sounds dangerous, Rick. Are you sure about this?
Rick: Trust me, Morty. We'll be fine. I've got a plan that will leave Batman scratching his pointy-eared head.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Alright, Rick. I'll go along with it. But if things go south, we're bailing, okay?
Rick: Fair enough, Morty. Now let's create a portal to Gotham City and show Batman who's the real genius here!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Gotham City]
Rick: Frick, Morty. We're in Gotham City. Keep your eyes peeled for any signs of Batman.
Morty: Crap, Rick. I don't see anything yet. What's the plan?
Rick: The plan is simple, Morty. We're going to lure Batman into a trap using our high-tech gadgets.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: High-tech gadgets? Since when did we have those, Rick?
Rick: Since always, Morty. I've been hoarding them in the garage. Now, let's set up a hologram of a priceless diamond and wait for Batman to take the bait.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Alright, Rick. I'll set up the hologram. But how are we going to defeat Batman once he's caught?
Rick: Easy, Morty. We'll use our portal guns to create a portal beneath him and drop him into a dimension of our choosing.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Drop Batman into another dimension? That sounds intense, Rick.
Rick: It's the only way to teach him a lesson, Morty. Now, let's hide and wait for Batman to take the bait.
[Rick and Morty hide and wait for Batman]
Rick: Morty, look! Batman is approaching the hologram. Get ready to activate the portal!
Morty: Shoot, Rick. He's getting closer. I'm activating the portal now!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: We did it, Morty! Batman fell right into our trap. Now, let's decide which dimension to drop him into.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. This feels wrong. Shouldn't we let him go?
Rick: Morty, Batman can handle himself. Plus, he needs to learn that he's not the only one who can play mind games.
Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. So, which dimension are we dropping him into?
Rick: How about the dimension where everything is made of marshmallows? That should teach him a lesson.
Morty: Alright, Rick. Let's send Batman to the marshmallow dimension. But after this, can we please go back to doing something normal?
Rick: Sure thing, Morty. But remember, adventure is always just a portal away. Wubba lubba dub dub!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I can't argue with that. Let's get this over with.
