Rick: Morty, we've got a special mission today.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what is it this time?
Rick: We're going to meet Batman, Morty.
Morty: Batman? As in the Dark Knight Batman?
Rick: That's right, Morty.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: But why, Rick? What do we have to do with Batman?
Rick: We need his help, Morty. I can't tell you more right now. 
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Back Alley]
Rick: Here we are, Morty. Gotham City. 
Batman: Who are you two? What are you doing in my city?
Rick: Relax, Batman. We're not here to cause trouble. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. He's scary.
Rick: Don't be such a wuss, Morty. Batman, we need your help.
Batman: Why should I help you?
Rick: Because, Batman, we're dealing with a threat that's bigger than your usual rogue's gallery.
Batman: Is that so? And what might that be?
Rick: It's a multidimensional criminal, Batman. He's causing havoc across the multiverse.
Batman: Multiverse? I'm not sure I follow.
Rick: It's like this, Batman. There are multiple realities, each with their own version of Earth.
Batman: And this criminal is jumping between these realities?
Rick: Exactly, Batman. And we need your help to stop him.
Batman: I see. And why should I believe you?
Rick: Because, Batman, we're the only ones who can stop him. And we need your help. 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I hope he believes us.
Rick: He will, Morty. He's Batman. He's seen it all.
Batman: Very well. I'll help you. But I'm watching you two closely.
Rick: That's all we ask, Batman.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww frick, Rick. This is gonna be one hell of an adventure.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Wubba lubba dub dub!
Batman: I have no idea what that means.
Rick: Don't worry about it, Batman. Let's get to work.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Alright, Morty. Let's get ready for this mission.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I hope we can handle this.
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. We've got Batman on our side. We'll be fine.
Morty: I sure hope so, Rick. I sure hope so.
