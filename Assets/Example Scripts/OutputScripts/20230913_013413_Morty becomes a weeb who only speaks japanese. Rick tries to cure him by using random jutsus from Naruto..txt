Narrator: Morty becomes a weeb who only speaks japanese. Rick tries to cure him by using random jutsus from Naruto.
Narrator: Prompt By: Whatsfdmlatefda
Rick: Morty, I need you to help me with this experiment.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: はい、リック、何をすればいいですか？(Yes, Rick, what should I do?)
Rick: Uh, Morty, why are you speaking Japanese?
Morty: リック、何を言っていますか？私はただ日本語を話しているだけです。(Rick, what are you saying? I'm just speaking Japanese.)
Rick: Frick, Morty, you've become a weeb. This is worse than the time you turned into a car.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: リック、私は何をすればいいですか？(Rick, what should I do?)
Rick: Alright Morty, let's try something. I'm going to use a jutsu from Naruto to cure you.
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: Alright, here goes nothing. Kage bunshin no jutsu!
[Rick walks to Center Stage]
Rick: Did it work, Morty?
Morty: リック、それは何も変えませんでした。(Rick, it didn't change anything.)
Rick: Shoot, I guess I need to try a different jutsu.
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: Alright, let's try this again. Katon: Gōkakyū no Jutsu!
[Rick walks to Center Stage]
Rick: How about now, Morty?
Morty: まだ日本語を話しています、リック。(I'm still speaking Japanese, Rick.)
Rick: Crap, this is harder than I thought. Let's try one more jutsu.
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: Here goes nothing. Chidori!
[Rick walks to Center Stage]
Rick: Did it work, Morty?
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I think it worked. I'm speaking English again.
Rick: Thank god, Morty. I was about to run out of jutsus.
Morty: Thanks, Rick. I don't know how I became a weeb, but I'm glad I'm back to normal.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! Let's get back to work. We have a lot of science to do.
