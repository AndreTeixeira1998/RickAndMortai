Narrator: Prompt By: Matty1406
Rick: Morty, do you remember the DK Rap?
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, uh, you mean from Donkey Kong 64, Rick?
Rick: That's the one, Morty. There's something about that song, Morty. It's a masterpiece.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww, jeez, Rick. Are we really gonna do this?
Rick: Yes, Morty. We're gonna sing it. We're gonna frickin' sing the DK Rap!
[Rick walks to Center Stage]
Rick: He's the leader of the bunch, you know him well, he's finally back to kick some tail!
Morty: Uh, uh, His coconut gun can fire in spurts, if he shoots ya, it's gonna hurt!
Rick: He's bigger, faster, and stronger too, he's the first member of the DK crew!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, DK, Donkey Kong is here!
Rick: This Kong's got style, so listen up dudes, she can shrink in size, to suit her mood!
Morty: Uh, uh, She's quick and nimble when she needs to be, she can float through the air and climb up trees!
[Rick walks to Morty]
Rick: If you choose her, you'll not choose wrong, with a skip and a hop, she's one cool Kong!
Morty: Uh, D, D, DK! Donkey Kong!
[Rick walks to Center Stage]
Rick: He has no style, he has no grace, this Kong has a funny face!
Morty: He can handstand when he needs to, and stretch his arms out, just for you!
[Rick walks to Morty]
Rick: Inflate himself just like a balloon, this crazy Kong just digs this tune!
Morty: Uh, DK, Donkey Kong is here!
[Rick walks to Center Stage]
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! That was fun!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. That was... interesting.
Rick: Well, Morty, sometimes it's good to let loose and have a little fun!
Morty: Yeah, I guess you're right, Rick.
