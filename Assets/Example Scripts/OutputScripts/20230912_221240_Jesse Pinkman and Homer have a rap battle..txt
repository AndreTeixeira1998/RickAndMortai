Homer: D'oh! Who are you two?

Rick: Relax, Homer. We're just here for a friendly rap battle.

Morty: Yeah, Homer. Don't have a cow, man.

Homer: A rap battle? Well, alright then. Let's do this!

[Homer walks to Center Stage]

Rick: Alright, Morty. We'll take turns. You go first.

Morty: Uh, okay. Here goes nothing.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Yo, yo, yo, I'm Morty G, the rap prodigy.
I'm kickin' rhymes so fresh, you won't believe.
I may be small, but I got the flow,
I'll show you what I got, let's go, bro!

[Homer walks to Center Stage]

Homer: D'oh! That was pretty good, Morty. But now it's my turn.

[Homer walks to Center Stage]

Homer: I'm Homer J, the king of Springfield.
I'll rap so hard, you'll be begging for yield.
I eat donuts all day, that's my jam,
I'm the coolest dad, just ask Bart and Pam!

[Rick walks to Center Stage]

Rick: Alright, Homer. You think you're cool?
Well, let me show you the real rap school.
I'm Rick Sanchez, the genius of the multiverse,
I'll drop rhymes so sick, it'll make you curse!

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Rick, that was awesome! But I'm not done yet.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: I'm Morty G, the rap sensation,
I'll rap circles around your whole damn nation.
I may be nervous, but I'll still prevail,
I'm the underdog, but I won't fail!

[Homer walks to Center Stage]

Homer: D'oh! That was impressive, Morty. But watch this.

[Homer walks to Center Stage]

Homer: I'm Homer J, the rap master,
I'll rap so fast, it'll cause a disaster.
I may be lazy, but I'll still win,
I'll be the rap king, let the battle begin!

[Rick walks to Center Stage]

Rick: Alright, Homer. You're not bad, I'll give you that.

[Rick walks to Center Stage]

Rick: I'm Rick Sanchez, the rap god,
I'll drop rhymes so hard, it'll leave you awed.
I'm the smartest man in any dimension,
I'll rap circles around you, it's my intention!

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Rick, that was amazing! But I have one more verse.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: I'm Morty G, the rap sensation,
I'll rap so fast, it'll cause a vibration.
I may be shy, but I'll still shine,
I'll rap my heart out, one line at a time!

[Homer walks to Center Stage]

Homer: D'oh! That was fantastic, Morty. But now it's my turn.

[Homer walks to Center Stage]

Homer: I'm Homer J, the rap legend,
I'll rap so hard, it'll make you beg for redemption.
I may not be the smartest, but I'm the funniest,
I'll leave you in stitches, it's no contest!

[Rick walks to Center Stage]

Rick: Alright, Homer. You've got some skills.

[Rick walks to Center Stage]

Rick: I'm Rick Sanchez, the rap guru,
I'll drop rhymes so sick, it'll make you spew.
I may be drunk, but I'm still on top,
I'll rap circles around you, non-stop!

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Rick, that was insane! I think we're done here.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: I'm Morty G, the rap sensation,
I'll rap my heart out, without hesitation.
I may be young, but I've got the fire,
I'll keep rapping till I retire!

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]

Rick: Well, Morty, that was quite the rap battle.

Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I can't believe we rapped with Homer Simpson.

Rick: Yeah, Morty. It was an epic crossover. Another dimension conquered!

Morty: Uh, Rick, can we go back to our own dimension now? I need a break.

Rick: Sure thing, Morty. Let's head back home.
