Narrator: Prompt By: Peanut M
Rick: Morty, get over here! I've stumbled upon something... interesting.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, uh, what is it, Rick? You've got that look on your face.
Rick: Morty, it's Shrek... on xhamster. 
Morty: Shrek? On xhamster? Aww jeez, Rick, that's messed up.
Rick: Well, Morty, the multiverse is a weird place. 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: But, uh, why would someone upload a Shrek video to xhamster?
Rick: Well, Morty, there's a fetish for everything. Even for big, green ogres.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: This is really fricked up, Rick. 
Rick: Yeah, it's a real crap show, Morty. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: So, uh, what do we do now, Rick?
Rick: Well, Morty, we're going to find out who's behind this. 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Are you sure that's a good idea, Rick? 
Rick: Morty, when have I ever had a bad idea?
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, uh, re re really often, Rick.
Rick: Well, Morty, there's a first time for everything. Let's go!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Rick: Shrek, we need to talk. 
[Shrek walks to Rick]
Shrek: What's all this about, Rick?
Rick: Someone's been uploading your videos to xhamster, Shrek.
Shrek: What? That's a load of crap!
[Donkey walks to Rick]
Donkey: Rick, you gotta help us! We don't want Shrek's videos on xhamster!
Rick: Don't worry, Donkey. We'll track down the culprit.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! We're on the case!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. This is going to be one weird adventure.
