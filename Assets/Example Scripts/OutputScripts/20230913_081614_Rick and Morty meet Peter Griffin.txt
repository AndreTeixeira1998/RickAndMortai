Narrator: Rick and Morty meet Peter Griffin
Narrator: Prompt By: PewPew
Rick: Morty, I've just invented a new device that can transport us to any animated universe we want.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, re-re-really Rick? That's uh, that's frickin' crazy.
Rick: Let's test it out, Morty. I'm thinking... Quahog.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Rick: Shoot! Wrong portal, Morty. These Springfielders are too yellow for my taste.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Isn't that a bit racist?
Rick: It's not racist, Morty. They're literally yellow.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Well, uh, I guess that's true.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Let's try that again, Morty. To Quahog!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Hold on, Rick. Isn't Peter Griffin from Family Guy a bit... unpredictable?
Rick: That's what makes it fun, Morty. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Back Alley]
Rick: Crap! This isn't Quahog, Morty. It's some dodgy back alley.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Can't we just go home?
Rick: Not until we've met Peter Griffin, Morty. Let's try one more time.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Okay, Rick. But if we end up in another wrong place, I'm going home.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Rick: Frick! This isn't Quahog either. It's Shrek's swamp.
Morty: That's it, Rick. I'm going home.
Rick: Wait, Morty. Look over there. It's Peter Griffin!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, Rick. That's not Peter Griffin. That's Donkey.
Rick: Oh... well, close enough.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well, Morty, that was a fun adventure, wasn't it?
Morty: If by fun, you mean terrifying and confusing, then yeah, Rick. It was real fun.
