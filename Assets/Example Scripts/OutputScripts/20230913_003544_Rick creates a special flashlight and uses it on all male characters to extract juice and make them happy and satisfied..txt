Rick: Morty, I've got something new to show you.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Oh, uh, what is it this time, Rick?
Rick: It's a happiness flashlight, Morty. 
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: A happiness flashlight? What does it do, Rick?
Rick: It extracts the essence of joy from a person, Morty. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: That sounds... really weird, Rick. Are you sure it's safe?
Rick: Of course, Morty, it's as safe as a frickin' teddy bear. Let's give it a try.
Rick: First, we'll test it on your dad.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Hey Jerry, check this out.
Jerry: What is it, Rick?
Rick: Just a little experiment. Hold still.
Rick: See, Morty? He's happy as a clam now.
Morty: Uh, yeah, Rick. But doesn't this seem a bit... invasive?
Rick: Morty, who wouldn't want to be happy all the time?
Morty: Well, I guess that's true, but...
Rick: No buts, Morty. Let's keep going.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Rick: Hey Homer, mind if we try something?
Homer: D'oh, what is it now, Rick?
Rick: Just a little happiness boost.
Homer: Mmm... happiness.
Rick: See, Morty? It works like a charm.
Morty: Yeah, Rick, but isn't this kind of manipulative?
Rick: Morty, you're overthinking it. Let's go to the next dimension.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Rick: Hey Shrek, check this out.
Shrek: Oi, what's that, Rick?
Rick: Just a little happiness boost.
Shrek: Ah, that's much better, Rick.
Rick: Morty, even Shrek likes it.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. This still doesn't seem right.
Rick: Morty, we're spreading joy. There's nothing wrong with that.
Morty: If you say so, Rick.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! Let's keep spreading the joy!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Starwars Cantina]

Yoda: Hmm, what is it, Rick?
Rick: Just a little happiness boost.
Yoda: Hmm, satisfied, I am.
Rick: See, Morty? Even Yoda approves.
Morty: Yeah, Rick, but what if they don't want to be happy all the time?
Rick: Morty, that's just silly. Everyone wants to be happy.
