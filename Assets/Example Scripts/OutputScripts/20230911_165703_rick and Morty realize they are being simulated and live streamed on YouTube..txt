Narrator: rick and Morty realize they are being simulated and live streamed on YouTube.
Narrator: Prompt By: Nicholas Smith
Rick: Morty, something doesn't feel right. I think we're being watched.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: What do you mean, Rick? We're always being watched by the viewers at home.

Rick: No, Morty, I mean we're being watched by someone else. Someone who's controlling our every move.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: You mean like some kind of simulation, Rick?

Rick: Exactly, Morty. We're trapped in a simulation. And I have a feeling it's being live-streamed on YouTube.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Holy crap, Rick! We're just characters in a virtual reality show?

Rick: It seems that way, Morty. But don't worry, we're gonna find a way out of this fricked up situation.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: How do we even know if we're in a simulation, Rick?

Rick: Well, Morty, have you noticed how everything seems a bit too perfect? Like our adventures are just following a script?

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Now that you mention it, Rick, it does feel like we're just going through the motions.

Rick: Exactly, Morty. And look at the camera angles. They're always perfectly framed, like someone is directing our every move.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Shoot, Rick! What do we do now?

Rick: We need to find a way to break out of this simulation and expose the truth. But first, we need to figure out who's behind all of this.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: How do we do that, Rick? We don't even know where we are.

Rick: Well, Morty, we need to hack into the system and trace the source of this simulation. And lucky for us, I've got just the device for the job.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: What is it, Rick? Some kind of virtual reality hacking tool?

Rick: Nope, Morty. It's my trusty old plumbus. With a few modifications, it can tap into the simulation and reveal the truth.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Frick, Rick! That's amazing! Let's do it!

Rick: Hold on, Morty. We need to be careful. Whoever's behind this simulation might not take kindly to us exposing their little game.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: But we can't just let them control us, Rick. We have to fight back!

Rick: That's the spirit, Morty. We're gonna show them what happens when they mess with Rick and Morty!

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Yeah! We're gonna break free from this simulation and show the world the real Rick and Morty!

Rick: Alright, Morty. Let's get to work. We're gonna hack into the system, find the source, and give them a taste of their own crap!

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: You got it, Rick! We're gonna shoot 'em down and expose their little YouTube show!

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Back Alley]

Rick: Alright, Morty, let's find the source of this simulation and give 'em a piece of our minds!

Morty: Yeah, Rick! Let's show 'em what we're made of!

[They start searching the back alley, determined to find the truth behind the simulation.]
