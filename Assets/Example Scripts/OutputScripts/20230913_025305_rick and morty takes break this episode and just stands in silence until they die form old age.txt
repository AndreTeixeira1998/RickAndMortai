Narrator: rick and morty takes break this episode and just stands in silence until they die form old age
Narrator: Prompt By: MrTheBezamat
Rick: Morty, have you ever just... stopped to think? 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, think about what, Rick?
Rick: About everything, Morty. About life, the universe, and all the crap we've seen.
Morty: Well, uh, not really, Rick. We're usually too busy running away from aliens or fighting inter-dimensional beings.
[Rick walks to Center Stage]
Rick: Exactly, Morty! That's precisely my point. We're always on the go. We never take the time to appreciate the small things.
Morty: Like what, Rick? Like the time you turned yourself into a pickle?
Rick: No, Morty. Not like the time I turned myself into a pickle. More like... the time we spent together as a family. Or the time we sat in the garage, just talking about random nonsense.
Morty: Oh, I see, Rick. So what do you suggest we do?
Rick: I suggest we take a break, Morty. Just stand here, in silence, and think. 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, okay, Rick. But, uh, for how long?
Rick: Until we die of old age, Morty.
Morty: Wait, what? Rick, that's crazy! We can't just stand here and do nothing!
Rick: Why not, Morty? We've done everything else. We've travelled through dimensions, fought aliens, and even messed with the fabric of reality itself. What's wrong with doing nothing for a change?
Morty: Uh, well, when you put it like that, Rick...
Rick: Exactly, Morty. Sometimes, doing nothing is the greatest adventure of all.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I never thought about it that way. 
Rick: Well, Morty, it's about frickin' time you did.
[Rick and Morty stand in silence]
Narrator: And so, Rick and Morty stood in silence, contemplating the meaning of life, the universe, and everything else. They stood there, in silence, until they died of old age. As it turns out, the greatest adventure they ever had was doing absolutely nothing at all.
