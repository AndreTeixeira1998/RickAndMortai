Narrator: banana
Narrator: Prompt By: me
Rick: Morty, get your frickin' butt over here!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what's the emergency this time?
Rick: Morty, you won't believe it. I've discovered a dimension where everything is made of bananas!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Bananas? Seriously, Rick? That's the big emergency?
Rick: Morty, you don't understand. These bananas are not your ordinary fruit. They have the power to grant superhuman strength!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Superhuman strength? Are you shootin' me, Rick?
Rick: No, Morty, I'm dead serious. With these bananas, we could become the strongest beings in the multiverse!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Okay, Rick, but how do we access this banana dimension?
Rick: It's simple, Morty. We just need to create a portal using a banana peel and some interdimensional goo.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Interdimensional goo? Where the crap are we gonna find that, Rick?
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. I've got a stash of interdimensional goo hidden in the garage. Just grab that banana peel over there.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Alright, Rick, let's do this. But if we end up slip-slidin' into trouble, it's on you.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! That's the spirit! Let's create a portal to the banana dimension and become the kings of potassium!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Frick, Morty, look at this place! It's a freakin' banana paradise!
Morty: Holy crap, Rick! I've never seen so many bananas in my life.
Rick: That's right, Morty. Now grab a banana and take a bite. Feel the power coursing through your veins!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Whoa, Rick! I feel... I feel invincible!
Rick: That's the magic of the banana dimension, Morty. Now let's go show those interdimensional beings who's boss!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Morty, we're back in our dimension, but we've got the power of bananas on our side.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. What are we gonna do with all this banana power?
Rick: Morty, with great power comes great responsibility. We'll use it to protect the universe from evil, or maybe just make some killer banana splits.
