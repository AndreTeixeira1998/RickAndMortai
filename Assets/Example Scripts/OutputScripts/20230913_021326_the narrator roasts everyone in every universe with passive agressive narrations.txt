Narrator: the narrator roasts everyone in every universe with passive agressive narrations
Narrator: Prompt By: The Cat Brat
Narrator: In the infamous garage of Rick and Morty, a new day dawns. The smell of interdimensional exhaust and failed experiments fills the air. 

Rick: Morty, get your fricking butt over here! 

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Uh, Rick, what's the big deal now?

Rick: We're going on an adventure, Morty. An adventure to roast every being in every universe.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Uh, roast? Like, with words? 

Rick: Exactly, Morty! We're gonna use our superior intellect to roast everyone! Wubba lubba dub dub!

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. That sounds... uh... intense.

Rick: It's going to be a blast, Morty. Just you wait.

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]

Narrator: And so, they arrive at the Simpsons' house, a place where the satire is as rich as Mr. Burns and the family bonds are as loose as Homer's belt after a buffet.

Homer: Well, look who it is, Bart! It's the drunk scientist and his nervous grandson!

Rick: Nice one, Homer. I see you're still maintaining that beer belly with your Duff.

Bart: Eat my shorts, old man!

Rick: How original, Bart. It's not like I haven't heard that one a million times.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Uh, re-re-ally guys, can we just get along?

Narrator: With their mission accomplished in Springfield, Rick and Morty prepare for their next roast session.

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]

Narrator: In the swamp, where the smell of onions is as potent as Shrek's love for solitude, our roasting duo arrives.

Shrek: What are you doing in my swamp?

Rick: Just dropping by to say hi, Shrek. I see you're still trying to make 'swamp chic' a thing.

Donkey: He got you there, Shrek!

Narrator: After leaving Shrek utterly speechless, Rick and Morty make their way to their final destination.

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Starwars Cantina]

Narrator: In the Star Wars Cantina, where the music is as repetitive as Jar Jar Binks' dialogue, our heroes prepare for their final roast.

Yoda: Hmm, unexpected this is.

Rick: Just like your grammar, Yoda.

Jar Jar Binks: Meesa no understand!

Rick: That's the point, Jar Jar.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I think we've done enough roasting for one day.

Rick: You're right, Morty. Let's head home.

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]

Narrator: And so, with their mission completed, Rick and Morty return home, leaving a trail of roasted characters in their wake. Truly, a day well spent.
