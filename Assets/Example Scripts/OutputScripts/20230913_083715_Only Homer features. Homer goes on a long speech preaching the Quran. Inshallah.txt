Narrator: Only Homer features. Homer goes on a long speech preaching the Quran. Inshallah
Narrator: Prompt By: H :c
Rick: Morty, I've got something to show you.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what is it this time?
Rick: It's a portal to another dimension, Morty. A dimension where things are a little different.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Different how, Rick?
Rick: Well, Morty, in this dimension, Homer Simpson is well-versed in the Quran and he's quite the preacher.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Homer Simpson? The beer-loving, donut-eating, couch potato?
Rick: That's the one, Morty. That's the one.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Homer: Welcome, Rick and Morty. I've been expecting you.
Rick: Well, that's a frickin' surprise.
Homer: I've found peace and wisdom in the teachings of the Quran. I've become a better man and I want to share it with you.
Rick: Shoot, this is heavy stuff, Homer.
Homer: It's not about how heavy it is, Rick. It's about finding the light in the darkness, the hope in despair, the good in the bad.
Morty: Uh, that's deep, Homer.
Homer: Yes, Morty. The Quran teaches us to be patient, to be kind, to love one another.
Rick: Crap, I didn't expect this from you, Homer.
Homer: The Quran also teaches us to respect all beliefs. I'm not trying to convert you, just sharing my journey.
Rick: Well, that's something. Thanks, Homer.
Homer: You're welcome, Rick. Remember, the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Morty: That was...unexpected.
Rick: It sure was, Morty. It sure was.
Morty: Do you think we'll ever see Homer again, Rick?
Rick: Who knows, Morty. Who knows. Let's get back to work. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Rick: And Morty, remember what Homer said about respecting all beliefs. It's important.
Morty: Yeah, Rick. I got it.
