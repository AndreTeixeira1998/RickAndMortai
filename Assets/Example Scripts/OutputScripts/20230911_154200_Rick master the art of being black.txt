Narrator: Rick master the art of being black
Narrator: Prompt By: é¯‰ & dope
Rick: Morty, get your ass over here! I've discovered something mind-blowing.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, Rick, what is it this time? And why are you talking like that?
Rick: Morty, I've mastered the art of being black. I'm talking smooth, street-smart, and cool as a cucumber.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, are you serious? You can't just master being a different race!
Rick: Oh, Morty, you always underestimate me. Watch and learn, Morty. Watch and learn.
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: Alright, Morty, check this out. I'm gonna drop some sick rhymes.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, Rick, I don't think this is a good idea.
Rick: Just trust me, Morty. Here we go. *clears throat* Yo, yo, yo, I'm Rickety Rick, the baddest dude in town. I'll frick you up with my science, make you look like a clown.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Oh, shoot. Rick, that was actually pretty good.
Rick: Of course it was, Morty. I'm a genius in all dimensions, even the dimension of rap.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Alright, Rick, show me some more of your "black" skills.
Rick: Alright, Morty, how about some smooth dance moves? Watch and learn.
[Rick walks to Center Stage]
Rick: *starts dancing* Crap, Morty, I'm like the king of the dance floor. Nobody can touch my moves.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Wow, Rick, that was actually impressive. I didn't know you had it in you.
Rick: Morty, being black is not about your skin color. It's about embracing a culture, a style, and a way of life. And I've mastered it all.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. It's not about the color, it's about the attitude.
Rick: That's right, Morty. Now, let's take our blackness to another dimension. We're heading to the Cantina in Star Wars world.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Starwars Cantina]
Rick: Alright, Morty, time to show off our blackness to Yoda and Jar Jar Binks.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I don't know about this. What if they don't like it?
Rick: Morty, we're blacker than the black hole. They'll love us.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Alright, Rick, let's do this. Show them what we got.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub! Let the blackness shine!
[Rick starts freestyling and dancing with Yoda and Jar Jar Binks]
Morty: Uh, uh, Rick, this is actually pretty fun. I'm feeling the groove.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Let the rhythm guide you. Embrace the blackness within.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I never thought I'd say this, but being black with you, Rick, is actually pretty cool.
Rick: I told you, Morty. When you embrace different cultures, you learn and grow. Now, let's take our blackness back home.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Ah, Morty, back in our good old garage. But remember, Morty, being black isn't just about the way you talk or dance. It's about understanding and appreciating different cultures.
Morty: Yeah, Rick, I get it now. It's about breaking barriers and embracing diversity.
Rick: That's my Morty, always learning and evolving. Now, let's go watch some TV and appreciate the beauty of the multiverse.
Morty: Sounds good, Rick. But, uh, let's not forget our roots and the importance of being true to ourselves.
Rick: Frick yeah, Morty. Shoot, I couldn't have said it better myself. Let's keep being us, no matter what dimension we're in.
Morty: Absolutely, Rick. Let's keep being the best versions of ourselves, no matter where our adventures take us.
