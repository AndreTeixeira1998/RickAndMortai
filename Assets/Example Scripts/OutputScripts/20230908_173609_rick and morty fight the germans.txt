Narrator: rick and morty fight the germans
Narrator: Prompt By Cipher Shell
Rick: Morty, quick! I need your help.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what is it now?
Rick: We've got some interdimensional Germans to deal with, Morty.
Morty: Germans? What the crap, Rick? Like, from World War II?
Rick: No, Morty. Not just any Germans. These are quantum Germans. They exist in multiple realities at once.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Quantum Germans? This is just getting ridiculous, Rick.
Rick: I know, Morty. It's a real pain in the ass. But we've got to deal with it.
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: I've got a plan, Morty. We're going to need to create a portal to their dimension.
Morty: Oh, shoot, Rick. This is going to be dangerous, isn't it?
Rick: Well, Morty, it's not exactly a walk in the park.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Back Alley]
Rick: Here we are, Morty. The home of the quantum Germans.
Morty: This place is a dump, Rick.
Rick: Well, Morty, it's not like they're going to live in a fancy castle or something. They're quantum Germans. They live in a quantum dump.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: So, what's the plan, Rick?
Rick: We need to find their leader, Morty. And then, we negotiate.
Morty: Negotiate? With quantum Germans? Are you kidding me, Rick?
Rick: No, Morty. I'm dead serious. Wubba lubba dub dub!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I've got a bad feeling about this.
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. I've got this under control.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well, Morty, that was a close one.
Morty: You can say that again, Rick. I never want to see another quantum German again.
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. I think we've seen the last of them. For now, at least.
Morty: Oh, thank god. I need a break, Rick. This quantum stuff is too much for me.
Rick: Hang in there, Morty. We've got plenty more adventures to come.
