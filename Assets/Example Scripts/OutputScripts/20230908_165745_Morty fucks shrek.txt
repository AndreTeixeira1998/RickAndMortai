Rick: Morty! I need you over here!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. What is it this time?
Rick: I've found a portal to another dimension, Morty. We're going to Shrek's swamp.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Shrek's swamp? Are you fricking serious, Rick?
Rick: As serious as a heart attack, Morty.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Shrek: What are you doing in my swamp?
Rick: Chill out, Shrek. We're just passing through.
[Morty walks to Shrek]
Morty: Hi, Shrek. I'm Morty. It's nice to meet you.
Shrek: Well, it's not every day I get visitors in my swamp.
Donkey: Hey, Shrek! Who are these guys?
Shrek: I'm not sure, Donkey. They just showed up.
[Morty walks to Donkey]
Morty: Hi, Donkey. I'm Morty. This is my grandpa, Rick.
Donkey: Hi, Morty! Nice to meet you!
Rick: Alright, enough with the pleasantries. We have to get back.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well, that was a trip.
Morty: Yeah, it was. Shrek and Donkey seem like nice guys.
Rick: Yeah, Morty, they're real gems. Now, let's get back to work.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: So, what's next, Rick?
Rick: Well, Morty, we've got a lot of work to do. But first, let's take a break.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Sounds good, Rick. I could use a break.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty. Wubba lubba dub dub!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Can't we just relax without you saying that?
Rick: No can do, Morty. It's my catchphrase.
