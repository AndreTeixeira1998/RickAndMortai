Rick: Morty, get over here. I've got something you've got to see. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, uh, what is it, Rick?
Rick: Behold, Morty. The Cosmic Nullifier. 
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Cosmic Nullifier? Is that like, uh, a fancy remote control or something?
Rick: No, Morty. It's a device that can erase anything from existence. And I mean anything.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. That sounds dangerous. 
Rick: Dangerous? Maybe. Necessary? Absolutely.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Necessary for what, Rick?
Rick: To erase the most annoying thing in the universe, Morty.
Morty: And what's that, Rick?
Rick: The Star Wars prequels, Morty. Especially that fricking Jar Jar Binks.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Uh, Rick, are you sure about this? I mean, they're not that bad.
Rick: Not that bad? Morty, they're a disgrace to the whole franchise. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: But erasing them from existence? Isn't that a bit extreme?
Rick: Extreme? Morty, it's the only way. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. This is really messed up.
Rick: Morty, sometimes you have to make tough decisions. Now, help me with this.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Starwars Cantina]
Rick: Alright, Morty. Let's find that fricking Jar Jar.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I'm not sure about this.
Rick: Morty, trust me. This is for the best.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well, Morty, we did it. The Star Wars prequels are no more.
Morty: Aww crap, Rick. I hope you know what you're doing.
Rick: Morty, when have I ever steered you wrong?
Morty: Uh, like, a lot of times, Rick.
Rick: Well, Morty, that's beside the point. The important thing is, we saved the universe from the prequels.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I guess you're right.
Rick: Of course I'm right, Morty. I'm always right. Wubba lubba dub dub!
