Rick: Morty, we've got something important to do today.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. What is it this time?
Rick: We're going to meet a celebrity, Morty. A big, green, celebrity.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Green? Are we meeting the Hulk or something, Rick?
Rick: No, Morty, not the Hulk. Someone even better. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Rick: We're going to meet Shrek, Morty.
Morty: Shrek? The ogre? Are you kidding me, Rick?
Rick: Nope, Morty. I'm dead serious. 
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Shrek: Well, hello there! Didn't expect to have visitors today.
[Rick walks to Center Stage]
Rick: Hello, Shrek. This is my grandson, Morty.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Hi, Shrek. It's nice to meet you.
Shrek: The pleasure is all mine, laddie.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Shrek is a lot bigger in person.
Rick: He sure is, Morty. He sure is.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: So, uh, what are we doing here, Rick?
Rick: We're here to ask Shrek for a favor, Morty.
[Morty walks to Shrek]
Morty: A favor? What kind of favor, Rick?
Rick: We need some of Shrek's swamp water, Morty. It's a crucial ingredient for my new invention.
Morty: Aww crap, Rick. You're not going to turn me into a swamp monster, are you?
Rick: No, Morty. This time, I promise, no transformations.
Morty: Alright, Rick. If you say so.
[Rick walks to Shrek]
Rick: So, Shrek, can we get some of your swamp water?
Shrek: Aye, you can. But only if Morty helps me with some chores around the swamp.
Morty: Aww frick, Rick. I didn't sign up for this!
Rick: Well, Morty, sometimes you've got to do what you've got to do. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Morty: I can't believe I just did chores for Shrek, Rick.
Rick: Well, Morty, at least we got the swamp water. Now we can get to work.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: I hope this invention is worth it, Rick.
Rick: Trust me, Morty. It will be.
