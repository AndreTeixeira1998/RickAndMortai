Narrator: Rick replaces Morty with Jesse Pinkman
Narrator: Prompt By: PROPLAYEN
Rick: Jesse, get your sorry ass in here!
[Jesse walks to Rick]
Jesse: Yo, Mr. White, what's up?
Rick: It's not Mr. White, Jesse. It's Rick. And I've got something interesting to show you.
[Jesse walks to Workbench]
Jesse: Alright, alright. Show me what you got, man.
Rick: Check it out, Jesse. It's a new formula I've been working on. It's called "Portal Meth."
[Jesse walks to Rick]
Jesse: Portal Meth? What the hell, Rick? Is this some kind of sci-fi drug?
Rick: You got it, Jesse. This stuff will take you to a whole new dimension of high. Literally.
[Jesse walks to Center Stage]
Jesse: Damn, Rick. You're always coming up with crazy shit. But is it safe?
Rick: Safe? Jesse, this is the purest meth you'll ever find. It's so potent, it'll blow your mind into another dimension.
[Jesse walks to Workbench]
Jesse: Alright, man. Let's give it a shot. But if I end up in some freaky alien world, it's on you.
Rick: Frick, Jesse. You worry too much. Let's fire up the portal and take a trip to another dimension.
[Rick and Jesse enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Holy crap, Jesse. We're in a whole new dimension!
Jesse: Shoot, Rick. This is wild. I've never seen anything like it.
Rick: Yeah, well, hold on tight, Jesse. We're about to go on a wild ride.
[Rick and Jesse enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Alright, Jesse. We're back in our dimension. How was that for a mind-bending experience?
Jesse: Damn, Rick. That was intense. But I gotta say, I've never felt more alive.
Rick: That's the power of science, Jesse. It can take you places you've never imagined.
Jesse: Yeah, man. Science is frickin' awesome.
Rick: You got that right, Jesse. Now, let's go cook up some more Portal Meth and conquer the multiverse!
Jesse: Hell yeah, Rick. Let's do this. Science, bitch!
