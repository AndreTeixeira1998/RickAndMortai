Narrator: Only Homer features. Homer goes on a long speech preaching the Quran. Inshallah
Narrator: Prompt By: H :c
Rick: Morty, we need to get a special ingredient for my latest experiment. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, another adventure? Can't we just relax for once?
Rick: Relax? Morty, this isn't the time for relaxation. This is the time for action!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Alright, Rick. What's the plan this time?
Rick: We're going to the Simpsons' house, Morty. I heard that Homer has the ingredient we need.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Homer: Hey, who are you guys? 
Rick: We're Rick and Morty. We're here to borrow something from you, Homer.
Homer: Borrow something? I don't know about that. I'm a simple man, I like my beer, my donuts, and my Quran.
Rick: Quran? Morty, did you hear that? Homer is a man of faith. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, yeah Rick. That's surprising. 
Homer: Surprising? Not at all. The Quran teaches us to be generous, to help others. Inshallah, I can help you with what you need. 
Rick: Well, that's fricking great, Homer. We need a special ingredient. It's called Quantum Doughnut.
Homer: Quantum Doughnut? I think I have one of those. Marge bought it for me, but I didn't eat it. It seemed too... fancy.
Rick: That's perfect, Homer. Can we borrow it?
Homer: Sure, take it. But remember, the Quran also teaches us to return what we borrow. 
Rick: We'll keep that in mind, Homer. Thanks for your help. 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Yeah, thanks Homer. We really appreciate it. 
Homer: No problem, boys. May Allah guide you on your journey. 
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well, Morty, we got what we needed. Now we can finish the experiment.
Morty: Yeah, Rick. But I'm still surprised about Homer. I didn't expect him to be so... religious.
Rick: Life's full of surprises, Morty. That's what makes it interesting. Now, let's get to work. Wubba lubba dub dub!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Here we go again.
