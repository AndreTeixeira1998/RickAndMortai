Narrator: Prompt By: Derpy Gamer
Rick: Morty, we got a problem!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Oh, oh crap, Rick! What's wrong now?
Rick: I've got a countdown timer in my head and I'm going to explode in 42 seconds!
Morty: Explode? What the frick, Rick? Why?
Rick: I don't know, Morty! It's probably one of those stupid booby traps I set for myself when I was drunk!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Oh, oh crap, Rick! What do we do? 
Rick: Quick, Morty, hand me that defibrillator over there!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: This? Are you sure, Rick?
Rick: Do it, Morty! It's our only shot!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Alright, Rick, here you go.
Rick: Thanks, Morty. Now stand back!
[Rick walks to Center Stage]
Rick: Here goes nothing! Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: Phew, we did it, Morty! The countdown stopped!
Morty: Oh, oh thank goodness, Rick! I thought you were gonna explode for real!
Rick: Me too, Morty, me too.
Morty: Aww, jeez Rick, why the frick would you set a booby trap for yourself?
Rick: I don't know, Morty, I was probably bored or something. 
Morty: Bored? You almost killed us, Rick!
Rick: Well, Morty, at least we're still alive, right? 
Morty: Yeah, I guess so, Rick. But next time, can you not set booby traps for yourself?
Rick: I'll try, Morty. But no promises.
Morty: Aww, jeez, Rick.
