Narrator: Rick tries to convince Morty that Putin is right about Ukraine
Narrator: Prompt By: Jack Davenport
Rick: Morty, come here for a second!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what's up now?
Rick: Morty, I've been doing some research and I've come to a shocking realization.
Morty: Oh no, what is it this time, Rick?
Rick: Putin, Morty. Vladimir Putin. He might actually be right about Ukraine.
Morty: What? Are you fricking kidding me, Rick? Putin's a dictator!
Rick: Well, Morty, sometimes even dictators can have a point. Shoot, I never thought I'd say this, but he might have a valid argument about Ukraine being in his sphere of influence.
Morty: Crap, Rick! You can't be serious! Ukraine deserves its own independence!
Rick: I get it, Morty. But let's look at the bigger picture here. Ukraine has always been a hot spot for geopolitical tensions. Maybe Putin's actions are just a response to the West's interference.
Morty: But Rick, that doesn't excuse his invasion and annexation of Crimea!
Rick: I'm not saying it does, Morty. But let's consider the historical context. Crimea has a majority Russian population, and it has strategic importance for Russia.
Morty: This is messed up, Rick! You're defending a tyrant!
Rick: I'm not defending him, Morty. I'm just trying to see things from a different perspective. Sometimes, the truth is more complex than we think.
Morty: I can't believe I'm hearing this, Rick. You're usually all about fighting for justice and freedom.
Rick: Look, Morty, I'm not saying I agree with everything Putin does. But we can't ignore the nuances of international politics. Sometimes, there are no easy answers.
Morty: This is so messed up, Rick. I can't believe you're trying to convince me of this.
Rick: Morty, I'm not trying to convince you of anything. I'm just challenging your perspective. It's important to question our beliefs and consider alternative viewpoints.
Morty: I don't know, Rick. This just feels wrong.
Rick: Well, Morty, life isn't always black and white. It's a series of gray areas. And sometimes, we have to navigate through those gray areas to find the truth.
Morty: I guess you have a point, Rick. But it's still hard for me to accept.
Rick: I understand, Morty. It's not an easy pill to swallow. But remember, questioning and critical thinking are the keys to growth and understanding.
Morty: Yeah, I guess you're right, Rick. It's just hard for me to wrap my head around it.
Rick: That's okay, Morty. It's okay to feel conflicted. Just remember, the world is a complex place, and sometimes, our preconceived notions need to be challenged.
Morty: Alright, Rick. I'll try to keep an open mind. But I still think Putin's actions are wrong.
Rick: And that's your right, Morty. We don't have to agree on everything. It's through healthy debate and discussion that we can find common ground and understanding.
Morty: Thanks, Rick. I appreciate your perspective, even if I don't fully agree.
Rick: No problem, Morty. It's all part of the adventure of intellectual exploration. Now, let's go find another dimension where we can debate interdimensional politics!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, alright, Rick. Let's do it. But can we please find a dimension where Putin isn't involved?
Rick: Of course, Morty. We'll find a dimension where the biggest political debate is about the best pizza toppings.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: That sounds much better, Rick. Let's go!
