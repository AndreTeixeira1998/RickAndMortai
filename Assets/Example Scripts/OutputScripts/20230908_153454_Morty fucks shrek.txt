Rick: Morty, I've got a new adventure for us.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what is it this time?
Rick: We're going to Shrek's swamp, Morty.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Shrek's swamp? You mean like... from the movie?
Rick: That's right, Morty. Now, let's go.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Shrek: Oi, who are you two?
Rick: We're just passing through, Shrek.
[Morty walks to Shrek]
Morty: Hi, I'm Morty. It's nice to meet you, Shrek.
Shrek: Well, it's not often we get visitors here.
Rick: Morty, let's not get too comfortable. We have work to do.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: What kind of work, Rick? We're in a freaking swamp!
Rick: We need to get some of Shrek's... essence.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Essence? What the frick, Rick?
Rick: It's for science, Morty! Now, go distract Shrek.
[Morty walks to Shrek]
Morty: So, Shrek, do you like... onions?
Shrek: Aye, I do. They're like ogres, y'know, they have layers.
[Rick walks to Center Stage]
Rick: Alright, I got what I needed. Let's get out of here, Morty.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Morty: What the crap, Rick? What was that all about?
Rick: It's a long story, Morty. Let's just say I needed some ogre essence for a new invention.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I don't even want to know.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Wubba lubba dub dub!
Morty: Yeah, yeah. Wubba lubba dub dub. Can we just watch some TV now?
Rick: Sure thing, Morty. Let's relax for a bit before our next adventure.
