Narrator: I can haz cheeseburger
Narrator: Prompt By: Zap Andersson
Rick: Morty, get your butt over here, I've got something to show you. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, uh, what is it, Rick?
Rick: Take a look at this, Morty. 
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: It's a cheeseburger. But not just any cheeseburger. 
Morty: Wha-what makes it so special, Rick? 
Rick: This, Morty, is a quantum cheeseburger. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: A quantum cheeseburger? What the frick does that mean, Rick?
Rick: It means, Morty, that this cheeseburger exists in multiple states at once. It's both delicious and disgusting simultaneously. 
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: I don't quite get it, Rick. How can something be both delicious and disgusting at the same time?
Rick: That's the beauty of quantum physics, Morty. It doesn't have to make sense. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I don't know if I want to eat a cheeseburger that could potentially taste disgusting. 
Rick: Well, Morty, we're not gonna eat it. We're gonna use it. 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Use it? For what, Rick?
Rick: To open a portal to another dimension, Morty. 
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Shrek: What are you doing in my swamp?
Rick: Oh shoot, wrong portal. 
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! We've got a quantum cheeseburger and a whole multiverse to explore!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Can we at least get some fries with that?
