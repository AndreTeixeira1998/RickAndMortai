Narrator: Rick and morty talk to batman
Narrator: Prompt By: me
Rick: Morty, get over here! I've made contact with Batman!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Whoa, Rick! Batman? Like, the Batman?
Rick: That's right, Morty. The Dark Knight himself. He's got some interdimensional problem he needs our help with.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: No way, Rick! We're gonna team up with Batman? This is gonna be frickin' awesome!
Rick: Well, hold your horses, Morty. Let's not get too excited. We still don't know what this problem is.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Alright, alright. So, what's the deal, Rick? Why does Batman need us?
Rick: Apparently, there's a supervillain wreaking havoc across dimensions. He's stealing all the donuts in every universe.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Donuts? Seriously, Rick? That's what Batman needs our help for?
Rick: Hey, Morty, don't underestimate the power of a good donut. It's a universal craving.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. Donuts are pretty important. So, what's the plan?
Rick: We're gonna use the portal gun to track down this donut thief. Batman will be our guide.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Awesome! I can't wait to meet Batman and kick some donut-stealing butt!
Rick: Easy there, Morty. We're not exactly the superheroes here. We're just tagging along.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Yeah, yeah, I know. But it's still gonna be cool, right?
Rick: It's gonna be something, Morty. Now, let's go meet Batman and save the multiverse from a donut crisis.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Gotham City]
Rick: Alright, Morty. We're in Gotham City. Keep your eyes peeled for Batman.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Holy crap, Rick! There he is! It's Batman!
Batman: I see you've arrived, Rick and Morty. We have no time to waste. The donut thief is causing chaos in the city.
Rick: Alright, Batman. Lead the way. We're ready to kick some donut-stealing butt.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Yeah! Let's teach that thief a lesson he won't forget!
[They all exit to the streets of Gotham City]
Rick: Alright, Batman, where do we start?
Batman: We follow the trail of crumbs, Rick. The thief is sloppy.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Crumbs? Seriously, Batman? That's your big clue?
Batman: Don't underestimate the power of a crumb, Morty. It can lead us to the donut thief's lair.
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: Alright, let's get this show on the road. We're gonna find that thief and make him regret messing with our donuts.
[They all exit to the dark alleys of Gotham City]
Morty: It's so dark and creepy here, Rick. I don't like it.
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. We've been in worse situations. Remember that time we were trapped in a giant alien's butt?
Morty: Yeah, I try not to think about that one, Rick.
Batman: Focus, gentlemen. We're getting closer to the thief's hideout.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Donut Thief's Lair]
Donut Thief: Ha! You fools! You'll never stop me from stealing all the donuts!
Rick: Alright, Donut Thief, you're about to get a taste of justice.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Yeah, justice with a side of donuts!
Batman: Let's show him the power of teamwork, Rick and Morty.
[They engage in an epic battle with the Donut Thief]
Rick: Take that, you donut-stealing scumbag!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Yeah, eat this, you frosting-loving jerk!
[They defeat the Donut Thief]
Batman: Well done, Rick and Morty. You've saved Gotham City from a donut crisis.
Rick: Yeah, yeah, don't mention it, Batman. Just another day in the multiverse for us.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. That was intense. Can we go back to our dimension now?
Rick: Sure thing, Morty. Let's head back home and relax. We've earned it.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! Another adventure in the books.
Morty: Yeah, Rick. But can we keep the donuts this time? I'm craving some sugar.
Rick: Of course, Morty. We've earned a treat. Let's dig in and enjoy the victory.
[They both grab a donut and take a bite]
Rick and Morty: Mmm, delicious!
