Narrator: Rick and morty fight batman
Narrator: Prompt By: me
Rick: Morty, we've got company! 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Who is it this time?
Rick: It's none other than Batman himself, Morty. 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Batman? You mean like the superhero? What's he doing here, Rick?
Rick: I might have borrowed something from his Batcave, Morty. 
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: And by something, I mean his Batmobile. 
Morty: You stole Batman's Batmobile, Rick? Are you fricking kidding me? 
Rick: I prefer the term 'borrowed indefinitely', Morty. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Shoot, Rick. We're in deep crap now. Batman's gonna kick our butts! 
Rick: Nah, Morty. We can handle him. 
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Alright, Morty. Get ready. Here he comes. 
Batman: Rick Sanchez, you have something that belongs to me. 
Rick: Well, Batman, I was just taking it for a test drive. 
Batman: Return the Batmobile now, or face the consequences. 
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Maybe we should just give it back. 
Rick: And admit defeat? Never, Morty! 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Well, I don't want to fight Batman, Rick. He's a superhero! 
Rick: And we're super geniuses, Morty. We can handle him. 
Batman: This is your last chance, Rick. Return the Batmobile. 
Rick: Or what, Batman? You'll throw a Batarang at us? 
Batman: If I have to.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Quick, Morty! To the workbench! We need to prepare for battle!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I can't believe we're about to fight Batman. 
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! Let's do this!
