Narrator: Prompt By: SvBSheep
Rick: Morty, grab your coat. We're about to witness something hilarious.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, Rick, what's going on now?
Rick: Shrek and Donkey are about to roast CodeBullet on YouTube.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: CodeBullet? The YouTuber who codes stuff?
Rick: That's the one, Morty. This is going to be epic.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Shrek: Donkey, are you ready to roast this CodeBullet guy?
Donkey: You bet, Shrek! Let's do this.
Rick: Alright, boys. Let's see what you got.
Shrek: CodeBullet, your code's so sloppy, it's like you're writing in mud.
Donkey: And your videos are so long, it's like watching grass grow.
Rick: Ha! Good one, Donkey.
Morty: Uh, guys, aren't we being a bit harsh here?
Donkey: Harsh? No way, Morty. This is all in good fun.
Shrek: Besides, if CodeBullet can't handle a little roasting, he shouldn't be on YouTube.
Rick: You tell 'em, Shrek.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, I hope CodeBullet takes this well.
Rick: He will, Morty. Besides, it's just a dis-track. Nothing serious.
Donkey: Yeah, Morty. Lighten up. It's just a bit of banter.
Shrek: Now, let's finish this off. CodeBullet, your code is so bad, it's like you're programming in donkey language.
Donkey: And your videos are so boring, they put Shrek to sleep. And trust me, that's not easy to do.
Rick: Ha! Nice one, guys. CodeBullet is going to have a hard time recovering from this.
Morty: Uh, Rick, maybe we should go now.
Rick: Alright, Morty. Let's head back.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well, Morty, that was fun, wasn't it?
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, I guess so.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! That's the spirit!
Morty: Yeah, yeah, Rick. Can we just watch TV now?
Rick: Sure, Morty. After all, adventure awaits us another day.
