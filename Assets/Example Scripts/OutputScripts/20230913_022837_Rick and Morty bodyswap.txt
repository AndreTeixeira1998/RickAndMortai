Narrator: Rick and Morty bodyswap
Narrator: Prompt By: AdamC
Rick: Morty, I've been working on something interesting.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. What is it this time?
Rick: It's a body swap device, Morty. I figured it might come in handy for some of our adventures.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Body swap device? That sounds like a frickin' nightmare, Rick!
Rick: Oh, don't be such a baby, Morty. It's not permanent. We can switch back whenever we want.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Alright Rick, let's do this. Just be careful with my body, okay?
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! Let's switch bodies!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick (in Morty's body): Shoot, Morty. This is weird. I forgot how awkward and gangly your body is.
Morty (in Rick's body): Hey, watch it Rick! This is really strange. Your body feels old and... crickety.
Rick (in Morty's body): Well, Morty, now you know what it's like to be a genius. It's not easy being this smart.
Morty (in Rick's body): And now you know what it's like to be a teenager, Rick. It's not easy dealing with all these hormones.
Rick (in Morty's body): Alright, enough chit chat. Let's switch back.
Morty (in Rick's body): Aww jeez, Rick. I don't know how to work this thing.
Rick (in Morty's body): Just press the button, Morty. It's not rocket science.
[Morty (in Rick's body) walks to Center Stage]
Morty (in Rick's body): Okay, here goes nothing.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick (in Morty's body): Crap, Morty. We're still in the wrong bodies!
Morty (in Rick's body): Oh no, Rick. What do we do now?
Rick (in Morty's body): We have to fix this, Morty. We can't stay like this forever.
[Morty (in Rick's body) walks to Workbench]
Morty (in Rick's body): Uh, Rick. I think I broke the device.
Rick (in Morty's body): Aww jeez, Morty. This is why we can't have nice things!
Morty (in Rick's body): I'm sorry, Rick. I didn't mean to.
Rick (in Morty's body): It's okay, Morty. We'll figure out a way to fix this. We always do.
[Morty (in Rick's body) walks to Rick]
Rick (in Morty's body): Now, let's get to work.
