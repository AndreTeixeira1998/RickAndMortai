Narrator: Rick and Morty meet Peter Griffin
Narrator: Prompt By: PewPew
Rick: Morty, I've just finished a new invention that can transport us to any dimension.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, Rick, aren't we already able to do that with the portal gun?
Rick: Yes, Morty, but this machine lets us go to dimensions that the portal gun can't reach. For example, the dimension where Family Guy is real.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Family Guy? Re-re-really, Rick? I mean, that's just a TV show.
Rick: Everything's a TV show somewhere, Morty. Now, let's go meet Peter Griffin.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Rick: Frick, Morty. I must have miscalculated. This is the Simpsons' house, not the Griffins'.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Can't we just go home?
Homer: Hey, who are you guys?
Rick: We're Rick and Morty from the dimension C-137. Nice to meet you, Homer.
Homer: Nice to meet you too. Would you like a Duff beer?
Rick: No, thanks. We're looking for Peter Griffin.
Homer: Peter Griffin? He lives in a different TV show. You're in the wrong place.
Rick: Shoot, I knew I should have double-checked the coordinates.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, Rick, maybe we should just go home. This is getting out of hand.
Rick: Fine, Morty. We'll go home. But I'm not giving up on meeting Peter Griffin.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well, Morty, that was a bust. But I'll fix the machine and we'll try again tomorrow.
Morty: Can't we just take a break, Rick? I mean, we've already been to the Simpsons' house. Isn't that enough for one day?
Rick: Morty, do you think Thomas Edison took a break when he was inventing the light bulb?
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, I don't know, Rick. Maybe he did.
Rick: Well, he didn't, Morty. And neither will we. Wubba lubba dub dub!
Morty: Aww, crap. Here we go again.
