Narrator: rick tries to make morty put a light bulbe up his butt
Narrator: Prompt By: MrTheRapi
Rick: Morty, I need you to do something for me.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, what is it, Rick?
Rick: I need you to put this light bulb up your butt.
Morty: What?! Rick, I-I-I can't do that!
Rick: Morty, it's crucial for our next adventure. It's a quantum light bulb.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Quantum light bulb? But, uh, why does it need to go up my butt, Rick?
Rick: It's all about location Morty. The quantum energy needs to be as close to your brain as possible. It can't go through your skull, so up the butt is the best route.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez Rick, are you sure there is no other way?
Rick: Trust me Morty, I've thought this through. It's the only way.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I can't believe I'm doing this. I feel like a frickin' light bulb warehouse.
Rick: It's for science, Morty. Besides, it's not like it's the first time you've done something like this.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: That's not making it any better, Rick!
Rick: Morty, do you want to have another adventure or not?
Morty: Aww, shoot Rick. Fine, let's do it.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Jerry: Hey, what are you two up to?
Rick: Nothing, Jerry. Just some science stuff. 
Jerry: Oh, okay. Carry on then.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Alright Morty, time to insert the bulb.
Morty: Aww crap Rick, I'm really not looking forward to this.
Rick: Don't worry Morty, it'll be over before you know it.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. This better be worth it.
Rick: It will be, Morty. Wubba lubba dub dub!
