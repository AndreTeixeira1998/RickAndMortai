Narrator: Morty fucks shrek
Narrator: Prompt By: me
Rick: Morty, I found a new dimension we can explore.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, another one? Can't we just stay in one place?
Rick: Morty, the multiverse is full of wonders! We can't just sit around.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Fine, Rick. Where are we going this time?
Rick: We're going to Shrek's Swamp.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Shrek's Swamp? Isn't that from a movie?
Rick: Everything's real somewhere, Morty.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Shrek: Who are you two doing in my swamp?
Rick: Calm down, big guy. We're just here to explore.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. He doesn't seem too happy about us being here.
Rick: Don't worry about it, Morty. We'll be out of his hair in no time.
[Donkey walks to Morty]
Donkey: Hey there, little fella! You look like you could use a friend.
Morty: Uh, thanks? But I already have a friend.
Donkey: Well, the more the merrier!
Rick: Morty, let's get moving. We've seen enough here.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww, but I was just getting to know Donkey.
Rick: We can't afford to waste time, Morty. There's a whole multiverse out there!
Shrek: Fine, leave then. I didn't want you here in the first place.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: See, Morty? That wasn't so bad.
Morty: Yeah, I guess you're right, Rick. But I kind of liked Donkey.
Rick: Well, Morty, we can always visit him again. But for now, we have other dimensions to explore.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Can't we just take a break?
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! There's no time for breaks in the multiverse!
