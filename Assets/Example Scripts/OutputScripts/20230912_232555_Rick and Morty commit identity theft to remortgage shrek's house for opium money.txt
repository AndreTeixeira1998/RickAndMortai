Narrator: Rick and Morty commit identity theft to remortgage shrek's house for opium money
Narrator: Prompt By: RoastedToasted
Rick: Morty, I think I've figured out a way to pay off our opium debts.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I uh, I didn't even know we had opium debts.
Rick: That's because you're too busy worrying about your little teenage problems, Morty.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: So, uh, what's your plan, Rick?
Rick: We're going to commit identity theft, Morty.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: What?! Rick, that's illegal!
Rick: Only if you get caught, Morty. Now, let's go to Shrek's Swamp. He's got a nice little house that we can remortgage.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Shrek: Oi, what are you two doing here?
Rick: Shrek, my man, we're here to help you with your mortgage.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, Rick, are you sure this is a good idea?
Rick: Trust me, Morty. I've done this a million times.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I have a bad feeling about this.
Rick: Relax, Morty. We're just going to borrow Shrek's identity for a bit. No harm done.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Borrow? Rick, that's still theft!
Rick: Call it what you want, Morty. I call it survival.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Alright, Morty. Now we just need to fill out these papers and we're good to go.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: This feels wrong, Rick.
Rick: Life's tough, Morty. Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. But if we get caught, I'm blaming you.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! That's the spirit!
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: Alright, Morty. The papers are filled out. Now we just need to wait for the money.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I hope this works.
Rick: It will, Morty. It always does.
