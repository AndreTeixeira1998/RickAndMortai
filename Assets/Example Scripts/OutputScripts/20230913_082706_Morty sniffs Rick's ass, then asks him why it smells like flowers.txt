Narrator: Morty sniffs Rick's ass, then asks him why it smells like flowers
Narrator: Prompt By: bcotrim12
Rick: Morty, I've got something brewing, and I ain't talking about a hangover cure.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, Rick, why does your uh, uh, rear end smell like flowers?
Rick: Oh, that? That's just the result of my latest experiment, Morty. 
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Experiment? What kind of experiment makes your butt smell like a fricking garden, Rick?
Rick: Not just any garden, Morty. A garden from the Floral Dimension.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: The Floral Dimension? Is that a place where everything smells good?
Rick: More or less, Morty. It's a dimension where everything is made of flowers. Even the crap.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: So, you went to the Floral Dimension and now your butt smells like flowers? That's just...weird, Rick.
Rick: Weird? Morty, in the grand scheme of the multiverse, this is barely a blip on the weirdness scale.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Well, it's still weird to me, Rick. And kinda gross, if I'm being honest.
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: Well, Morty, you're going to have to get over it. We've got bigger fish to fry. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Bigger fish? What do you mean, Rick?
Rick: I mean, Morty, we've got a mission. A mission that involves the Floral Dimension.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: A mission? Aw jeez, Rick, I'm not sure I'm ready for another adventure.
Rick: Too late, Morty. We're going in. Hold your nose.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Morty: Uh, Rick? This doesn't look like the Floral Dimension.
Rick: Shoot, Morty, I must've entered the wrong coordinates. We're in the Simpsons' house.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Let's try that again, Morty. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Floral Dimension]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Now everything smells like flowers.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Now, let's get to work.
