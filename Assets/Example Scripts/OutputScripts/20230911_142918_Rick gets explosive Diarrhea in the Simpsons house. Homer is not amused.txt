Narrator: Prompt By: MistahHeffo
Rick: Morty, get over here! I've got something incredible to show you.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. What is it this time?
Rick: It's not just any dimension, Morty. We're going to the Simpsons House!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: The Simpsons House? Like, from the TV show?
Rick: That's right, Morty. We're going to have some fun with those yellow folks.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Alright, Rick. But please, no more exploding toilets or anything like that.
Rick: Morty, I promise. We'll just have a little harmless adventure. Now, let's enter the portal to the Simpsons House!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Rick: Ah, here we are, Morty. The iconic living room of the Simpsons House.
Morty: Wow, it looks just like the show. Hey, who's that sitting on the couch?
Rick: Oh, that's Homer Simpson, Morty. He's the head of the Simpson family.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Hey, Homer! What's up?
Homer: D'oh! Who the heck are you?
Rick: Relax, Homer. We're just a couple of interdimensional travelers.
Morty: Yeah, we're here to have some fun. Maybe even learn a thing or two.
Homer: Well, I don't know about that. This is my house, and I don't appreciate strangers barging in.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Sorry, Homer. We didn't mean to intrude. We'll just be on our way.
Rick: Morty, wait! I just remembered something. I have a special formula that can make donuts taste even better!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Donuts? Really, Rick? That's your big plan?
Rick: Trust me, Morty. Homer here is a big fan of donuts. If we can make them even more delicious, he'll love us!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Alright, Rick. Let's give it a shot. But if this backfires, I'm blaming you.
Rick: No worries, Morty. I'm a professional. Now, let's get to work at the workbench.
[Rick walks to Workbench, Morty walks to Workbench]
Rick: Alright, Morty. Hand me the secret ingredient.
Morty: Here you go, Rick. The special flavor enhancer.
[Rick and Morty mix ingredients at the workbench]
Rick: Now, we just need to add this to the donuts and give them to Homer.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Hey, Homer. We've got a special surprise for you. Try these enhanced donuts.
Homer: Donuts? My favorite! Let me at 'em!
[Homer eats the donuts and his eyes widen]
Homer: Mmm, these are the best donuts I've ever had! You guys are alright!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Phew, it worked, Rick. Homer loves the donuts.
Rick: See, Morty? I told you my inventions never fail. Now, let's enjoy our time in the Simpsons House.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Yeah, Rick. This place is actually pretty cool. Maybe we can even catch an episode or two.
Rick: Sounds like a plan, Morty. Just remember, don't touch anything or cause any trouble.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Got it, Rick. We'll just sit back, relax, and enjoy the Simpson family's wacky adventures.
[They all settle down on the couch and start watching TV]
Homer: Woo-hoo! This is the life.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub!
