Narrator: Prompt By: vilzu v
Rick: Morty, I've got a new mission for us.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, what is it this time, Rick?
Rick: We need to find the best dad-joke in the entire universe, Morty.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: A dad-joke? Like the ones Jerry tells? Aww jeez, Rick, those are so lame.
Rick: Exactly, Morty! The lamer, the better! It's all in the delivery.
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: I've got a device here that can track the energy of a good dad-joke.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: How does that even work, Rick?
Rick: It's all about the groans, Morty. The bigger the groan, the better the joke.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: So, uh, where do we start, Rick?
Rick: Let's start with your dad, Morty. Jerry's got some real gems.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Jerry, hit us with your best dad-joke.
Jerry: Hmm, okay. Why don't scientists trust atoms?
Rick: I don't know, Jerry, why don't they?
Jerry: Because they make up everything!
Rick: Ha, not bad, Jerry. But we're looking for the best. We'll be back.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Rick: Marge, we need your best dad-joke.
Marge: Oh, I don't know. Homer usually tells the jokes around here.
Homer: I've got one! Why did the scarecrow win an award?
Morty: I don't know, why did the scarecrow win an award?
Homer: Because he was outstanding in his field!
Rick: Shoot, that's a good one, Homer. But we're not done yet.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Rick: Shrek, let's hear your best dad-joke.
Shrek: Okay, here's one. Why don't ogres play hide and seek?
Morty: I don't know, why don't they?
Shrek: Because they always get spotted!
Rick: Crap, that's a solid joke, Shrek. But we've got one more stop.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Starwars Cantina]
Rick: Yoda, we need a dad-joke.
Yoda: Hmm, a joke, you say. Why do not Jedi use bookmarks?
Morty: I don't know, why don't they?
Yoda: Because the page, they always find.
Rick: Frick, Yoda, that's deep. Alright, Morty, we've got some tough decisions to make.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, I think they're all pretty good.
Rick: No, Morty, we need the best. And I think I know just the one.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! The best dad-joke in the universe is... Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, I guess Jerry's not so lame after all.
Rick: Don't get carried away, Morty. He's still pretty lame. But his joke game is strong.
