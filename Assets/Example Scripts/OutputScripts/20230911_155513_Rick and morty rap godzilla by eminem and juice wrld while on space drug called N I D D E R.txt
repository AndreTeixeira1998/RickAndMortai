Narrator: Prompt By: é¯‰ & dope
Rick: Morty, I've got something special for us today. I've created a new space drug called N I D D E R. It's gonna take us on a wild ride!

[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Whoa, Rick! Are you sure it's safe? I mean, we've had some pretty crazy adventures already.

Rick: Safe? Morty, N I D D E R is as safe as shooting lasers from your eyes. Trust me, it's gonna blow your mind!

[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Alright, Rick. Let's give it a shot. But only because I trust you. And because I'm curious, you know?

Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Prepare to enter the realm of pure awesomeness!

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to a trippy dimension]

Rick: Whoa, Morty! Everything looks so... colorful and vibrant!

Morty: Uh, Rick, I think the N I D D E R is kicking in. I feel... different.

Rick: Don't worry, Morty. That's just the interdimensional high. Now, let's do something mind-blowing. How about we rap "Godzilla" by Eminem and Juice WRLD?

[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Rap? Are you serious, Rick? I'm not exactly a skilled rapper, you know?

Rick: Aw, come on, Morty! It's all about having fun. Plus, you're gonna be rapping like a pro in no time.

[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Alright, Rick. Let's give it a shot. But don't expect any miracles from me.

Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Alright, let's start. I'll take the first verse.

[Rick and Morty start rapping "Godzilla" by Eminem and Juice WRLD, with a trippy twist]

Rick: I'm a rap god, Morty, call me Godzilla
Spitting fire, burning down the villa
I'm a genius scientist, a lyrical killer
With N I D D E R, nothing's gonna be chiller

Morty: Uh, uh, Rick, I'm trying my best here
But these words are coming out all weird
I'm stumbling and fumbling, feeling so impaired
But hey, at least I'm rapping with flair

Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Let loose and let it flow
We're in another dimension, ain't no one gonna know
Just embrace the chaos, let the N I D D E R show
We're the rap gods, Morty, putting on a crazy show

[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Alright, Rick, I'm feeling it now. Let's keep it going.
I'm Morty, the sidekick, but I can still throw down
With N I D D E R in my veins, I wear the crown
I may be small, but I won't back down

Rick: That's my Morty! You're rapping like a pro
With N I D D E R, there's nowhere we won't go
We're unstoppable, Morty, we're in the flow
Rapping like gods, wherever we may go

[Rick and Morty continue rapping, the dimension around them becomes more trippy and surreal]

Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! We did it!

Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. That was... insane. I can't believe we just rapped like gods.

Rick: That's the power of N I D D E R, Morty. It takes you beyond your limits. But remember, with great power comes great responsibility.

Morty: Yeah, I get it, Rick. Let's just make sure we don't abuse this stuff. It's too intense.

Rick: Agreed, Morty. We'll keep it in moderation. But for now, let's enjoy the ride.

[Rick and Morty exit the portal, back in the Garage]

Morty: Whew, that was one crazy trip, Rick.

Rick: Yeah, Morty. But that's just a taste of what the multiverse has to offer. Adventure awaits us, my boy!

Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Can't we just have a normal day for once?

Rick: Normal? Morty, normal is overrated. We're extraordinary, and we're gonna keep pushing the boundaries of science and fun!

Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. Let's keep exploring, but maybe without the space drugs next time.

Rick: Fair enough, Morty. But don't forget, sometimes a little chaos can lead to the best adventures.

Morty: Yeah, yeah, I know. Wubba lubba dub dub, Rick.

Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty. Now let's clean up this mess and get ready for the next mind-bending escapade!

[They both start cleaning up the Garage, with a hint of excitement for what's to come]
