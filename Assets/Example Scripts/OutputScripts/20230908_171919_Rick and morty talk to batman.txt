Narrator: Rick and morty talk to batman
Narrator: Prompt By me
Rick: Morty, we're going to Gotham City.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Gotham City? Aww jeez, Rick, isn't that where Batman lives?
Rick: That's right, Morty. The one and only. 
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Gotham City]
Rick: Batman, we need your help.
Batman: What brings you to Gotham, Rick?
Rick: We've got a problem that's a bit out of our league. 
Batman: I'm listening.
Rick: There's a new villain in town, Morty and I can't handle him alone.
Morty: He's too powerful, Batman.
Batman: What's his name?
Rick: He calls himself the Quantum Joker.
Batman: Quantum Joker? Sounds like a handful.
Rick: He's more than a handful, Batman. He's a real pain in the ass.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, you didn't have to be so blunt.
Rick: This isn't the time for niceties, Morty. We're dealing with a serious threat here.
Batman: I'll help you, but we do it my way.
Rick: Fine, Batman. We'll do it your way.
Batman: Good. Now, tell me everything you know about the Quantum Joker.
Rick: He's not from our dimension. He's from a parallel universe where he's the ruler. 
Batman: And he wants to rule your universe too?
Rick: That's right, Batman.
Morty: And he won't stop until he gets what he wants.
Batman: Then we'll have to stop him. 
Rick: That's the spirit, Batman. Wubba lubba dub dub!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. You're getting excited about this.
Rick: Of course, Morty. We're teaming up with Batman! This is frickin' awesome!
Batman: Let's get to work.
[Rick, Morty and Batman leave to confront the Quantum Joker]
