Narrator: Prompt By: Magical Chords
Rick: Morty, get your ass over here! I've got something amazing to show you.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what is it this time?
Rick: It's the legendary Szechuan Sauce, Morty! I've traveled through time and space to get it.
Morty: Szechuan Sauce? Isn't that the sauce from that old McDonald's promotion?
Rick: That's right, Morty. It's the sauce that I've been craving for years. And now, I've finally found it.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, Rick, I don't get it. It's just a sauce. What's so special about it?
Rick: Morty, this sauce is more than just a condiment. It represents a time in my life when things were good. When I was happy.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Happy? You, happy? I find that hard to believe, Rick.
Rick: Well, Morty, believe it or not, there was a time when I had a family. A wife, a daughter, and a son.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Wait, what? You had a family?
Rick: Yeah, Morty. And during that time, McDonald's released the Szechuan Sauce as a promotion for the movie Mulan. It was delicious, Morty. The perfect blend of sweet and tangy.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: So, what happened to your family, Rick?
Rick: Life happened, Morty. I made some mistakes, and I lost them. But today, we're going to celebrate. We're going to recreate that moment of happiness.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: How are we going to do that, Rick?
Rick: We're going to have a family dinner, Morty. We're going to sit down, eat some Szechuan Sauce, and enjoy each other's company.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: That sounds nice, Rick. But, uh, what about Jerry?
Rick: Frick Jerry, Morty. He can stay in the yard. Tonight, it's just you, me, and the Szechuan Sauce.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Alright, Rick. Let's do it. Let's have a family dinner.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! That's the spirit. Let's make this the best damn family dinner ever.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Hey, Beth! Summer! Get your asses over here!
[Beth and Summer enter the Yard]
Beth: Rick, what's going on? Why are you so happy?
Rick: We're having a family dinner, Beth. A real one. With Szechuan Sauce.
Summer: Szechuan Sauce? Isn't that from that old McDonald's thing?
Rick: That's right, Summer. And tonight, we're going to eat like kings.
[Beth, Summer, Rick, and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Alright, everyone. Take a seat. It's time to dig in.
[They all sit at the table]
Beth: Rick, this sauce better be worth all the hype.
Rick: Trust me, Beth. It's worth every frickin' second.
[They all take a bite of the Szechuan Sauce]
Summer: Holy crap, Rick! This sauce is amazing!
Beth: I can't believe I've been missing out on this all these years.
Rick: I told you, Beth. It's a taste of pure happiness.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I can't believe we're actually having a happy family moment.
Rick: Enjoy it while it lasts, Morty. Shoot, we might even start a tradition.
[They all laugh and continue to enjoy their dinner]
Narrator: And so, for one fleeting moment, the Smith family found happiness. All thanks to a sauce from the past. But as we know, happiness is a rare commodity in the multiverse. Will this moment last? Only time will tell.
