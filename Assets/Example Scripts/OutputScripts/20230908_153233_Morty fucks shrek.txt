Rick: Morty, we're going on an adventure!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, again? Can't we just chill for once?
Rick: No time for chilling, Morty. We have important business to attend to.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Shrek: What are ye doin' in my swamp?
Rick: We're just passing through, Shrek. No need to get your panties in a twist.
Morty: Uh, hi Shrek. Big fan of your movies.
Shrek: Well, ain't that nice. What brings ye here?
Rick: We're on a quest, Shrek. A quest for knowledge.
Shrek: Knowledge, ye say? I might be of help. But first, ye must complete a task.
Rick: A task? What kind of task?
Shrek: Ye must...befriend my donkey.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww, he's cute. Hi, Donkey.
Donkey: Well, hello there! Nice to meet you.
Rick: Morty, we don't have time for this. Let's get on with it.
Morty: But Rick, he's so friendly. And he talks! That's amazing.
Rick: Sure, Morty. Amazing. Can we move on now?
Morty: Alright, alright. I'll see you later, Donkey.
Donkey: Bye, new friend! Come back soon!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Rick: Now, Shrek, about that knowledge...
Shrek: Right. The knowledge. Follow me.
Rick: Lead the way, big guy.
[Shrek walks to Center Stage]
Shrek: Here we are. The Tree of Wisdom. Ask it anything, and ye shall know.
Rick: Well, Morty, this is it. Time to ask your question.
Morty: Uh, okay. Tree of Wisdom, who is the best starter Pokémon?
Tree of Wisdom: The best starter Pokémon is subjective. It depends on your personal preference and play style.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. That's a pretty lame answer.
Rick: Well, Morty, not everything in life is clear cut. Sometimes, you just have to make your own decisions.
Morty: Yeah, I guess you're right, Rick.
Rick: Alright, let's get the frick out of here.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Another successful adventure, Morty. Wubba lubba dub dub!
Morty: Yeah, I guess so, Rick. But next time, can we do something less stressful?
Rick: Stressful? Morty, you need to toughen up. This is the life we lead. Get used to it.
Morty: Aww crap, Rick. Can't we just watch some TV?
Rick: Fine, Morty. We'll watch some TV. But only because I need to rest my genius brain.
