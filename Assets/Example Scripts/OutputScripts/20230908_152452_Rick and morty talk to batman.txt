Rick: Morty, I've been thinking. It's about time we met a real superhero.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. You're not talking about Superman, are you? His movies are kind of boring.
Rick: No, Morty, not Superman. Someone much cooler. Batman!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Batman? Seriously, Rick? I mean, he's just a rich guy with a lot of gadgets, right?
Rick: Exactly, Morty! And guess who also has a lot of gadgets? That's right, your grandpa Rick! 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: So, what? Are you saying you're like Batman?
Rick: No, Morty. I'm saying we could learn a thing or two from him. Plus, it would be fricking cool to meet Batman.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Well, I guess it could be fun. But how are we going to meet him? He's not real, Rick.
Rick: That's where you're wrong, Morty. In the multiverse, every fictional character exists in some dimension.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Alright, Rick. I'm in. Let's go meet Batman.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Back Alley]
Narrator: Rick and Morty land in a dimly lit alley. Suddenly, a dark figure emerges from the shadows.
Batman: Who are you and what are you doing in my city?
Rick: Oh shoot, it's Batman! We're just here to meet you, man. Big fans.
Batman: I don't have fans. I have enemies.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I think we made a mistake.
Rick: No, Morty. It's just a misunderstanding. Batman, we're not here to cause trouble.
Batman: Then why are you here?
Rick: We're here to learn from you, Batman. We're fellow gadget enthusiasts.
Batman: Well, in that case, welcome to Gotham. But remember, I'm watching you.
Morty: Thanks, Batman. And don't worry, we're not going to cause any trouble. Right, Rick?
Rick: Yeah, yeah. No trouble. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well, Morty, that was a crap ton of fun, wasn't it?
Morty: Yeah, Rick. I guess it was pretty cool to meet Batman.
Rick: See, Morty? Adventure awaits us in the multiverse. Now, let's get back to work. We have gadgets to build!
