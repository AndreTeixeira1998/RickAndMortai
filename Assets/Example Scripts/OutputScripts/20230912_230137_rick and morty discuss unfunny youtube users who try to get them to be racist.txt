Narrator: rick and morty discuss unfunny youtube users who try to get them to be racist
Narrator: Prompt By: kamudi
Rick: Morty, come here! I need your opinion on something.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, sure Rick, what's up?
Rick: I've been reading comments on our YouTube videos, Morty. Some of these users are trying to get us to say racist stuff.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, that's not cool at all. Why would they do that?
Rick: I don't know Morty, maybe they think it's funny. But it's not, it's just crap.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Yeah, it's re-really not funny at all. It's just plain wrong.
Rick: Well, Morty, the internet is full of trolls. We just have to ignore them.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Yeah, I guess you're right, Rick. But it still sucks.
Rick: It sure does, Morty, it sure does. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: So, what do we do, Rick? 
Rick: We keep doing our thing, Morty. We ignore the trolls and focus on the fans who appreciate us for who we are.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Yeah, I guess that's all we can do, Rick.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Now let's get back to work.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Rick: And remember, Morty, don't let the trolls get to you. They're just trying to get a rise out of us.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Yeah, you're right, Rick. I won't let them bother me.
Rick: Good, Morty. Now let's get back to work. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I guess we're back to business, huh?
Rick: That's right, Morty. Back to business.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Rick: And remember Morty, no matter what they say, we're not racists. We're just a pair of interdimensional adventurers.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Yeah, Rick, I get it. We're not racists, we're adventurers. I'll try to remember that.
Rick: That's a good boy, Morty. Now, let's get back to work. We've got a universe to explore!
