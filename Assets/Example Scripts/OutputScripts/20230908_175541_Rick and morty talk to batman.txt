Narrator: Rick and morty talk to batman
Narrator: Prompt By: me
Rick: Morty, I've got a surprise for you.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. What is it this time?
Rick: We're going to meet a real superhero, Morty.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: A superhero? Like Superman or Spiderman?
Rick: Better, Morty. Batman.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Back Alley]
Batman: Who are you two?
Rick: Frick! I'm Rick and this is my grandson, Morty. We're from another dimension.
Batman: Another dimension? I've seen some strange things, but this is new.
Morty: We're big fans, Batman! We've read all your comics!
Batman: Comics? What are you talking about?
Rick: Never mind that, Batman. We came here to ask for your help.
Batman: What kind of help?
Rick: We need to defeat a supervillain in our dimension. He's called the Pickle King.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: He's really scary, Batman. He's turned everyone into pickles!
Batman: That does sound serious. I'll help you defeat this Pickle King.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: I'm going to need you to wear this, Batman.
Batman: Is this a pickle costume?
Rick: Yes, it's the only way to infiltrate the Pickle King's lair.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I can't believe we're making Batman wear a pickle costume.
Rick: It's for the greater good, Morty. Now, let's go kick some pickle butt!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Back Alley]
Rick: Alright, Batman. Let's do this.
Batman: I'm ready. Let's take down this Pickle King.
Morty: Good luck, Batman. You're our only hope.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Batman! Let's frickin' do this!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Shoot, we're back at the yard.
Morty: Crap, Rick. We entered the wrong portal!
Rick: Well, Morty. It looks like it's just you and me against the Pickle King.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I guess we're the real superheroes after all.
