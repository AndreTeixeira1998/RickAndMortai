[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: What? Are you serious, Rick? That's messed up!

Rick: Relax, Morty. It'll be fun. And we'll make sure it's all in good fun, you know, like a friendly competition.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: I don't know, Rick. I don't think Jerry would want to do that.

Rick: Oh, come on, Morty. Jerry's always up for some excitement. Plus, it'll be a chance for him to prove himself.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Alright, fine. But we better make sure it's safe for Jerry.

Rick: Don't worry, Morty. We'll set up some rules and boundaries. It'll be like a controlled Hunger Games.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Okay, if you say so, Rick. But I'm not gonna be responsible for any injuries.

Rick: Fair enough, Morty. Now let's go find Shrek and set up the arena.

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]

Rick: Shrek, my man! We've got a proposition for you.

[Morty walks to Shrek]

Morty: Hey, Shrek. We're gonna have a friendly competition with Jerry. It's gonna be like the Hunger Games.

Shrek: Donkey, did you hear that? We're gonna have some fun with these guys!

[Donkey walks to Morty]

Donkey: Oh, I'm in! Count me in, Morty!

Rick: Alright, let's set up the arena and establish some ground rules.

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]

Rick: Jerry, come here! We've got a surprise for you!

[Morty walks to Jerry]

Morty: Hey, Dad. Rick and I have come up with a fun game for you. It's like the Hunger Games.

Jerry: A game? Uh, uh, what do I have to do?

Rick: Simple, Jerry. You'll be competing against Shrek in a series of challenges. It'll be a battle of strength and wit.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Yeah, Dad. It's gonna be great! You'll have a chance to show off your skills.

Jerry: I don't know, guys. This sounds dangerous.

Rick: Don't worry, Jerry. We'll make sure everything is safe. Plus, it'll be a great opportunity for you to prove yourself.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Yeah, Dad. It's gonna be epic! You'll be like a hero in your own Hunger Games.
