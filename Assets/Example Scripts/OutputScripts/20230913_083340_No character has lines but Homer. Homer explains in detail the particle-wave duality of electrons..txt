Narrator: No character has lines but Homer. Homer explains in detail the particle-wave duality of electrons.

Homer: Oh hey there, Rick and Morty. Just in time for my lecture on particle-wave duality of electrons.

Homer: You see, the particle-wave duality is a frickin' weird concept. It's like trying to understand why Marge's hair is blue.

Homer: But here goes. Electrons, those tiny little suckers that go around atoms, they're not just particles. They're also waves. Yeah, I know, it's a load of crap.

Homer: It's like saying Bart is both a good kid and a troublemaker. But that's quantum mechanics for you.

Homer: So, you know how particles are, right? They're like little balls. You can throw 'em, catch 'em, do whatever you want with 'em.

Homer: But waves, well, they're different. They spread out. They interfere with each other. They do all sorts of weird shoot.

Homer: And electrons, they're both. They're particles when you look at 'em, but they're waves when you're not.

Homer: It's like Schroedinger's cat. Alive and dead at the same time. But with electrons, it's particle and wave.

Homer: Now, this might sound like a load of bull, but it's been proven. By a lot of smart guys. Guys smarter than me, if you can believe that.

Homer: They did this thing called the double-slit experiment. Sounds dirty, I know, but it's not.

Homer: They shot electrons at two slits, and you know what happened? The frickin' electrons interfered with each other. Like waves.

Homer: But here's the kicker. They did the same thing with one electron at a time, and it still made an interference pattern. Like it went through both slits at the same time.

Homer: That's the wave-particle duality for you. It's a real mind-frick.

Homer: So next time you're thinking about electrons, remember, they're not just particles. They're also waves. And they're probably laughing at you for trying to understand 'em.

Homer: But hey, don't let it get you down. After all, we're just a bunch of particles and waves ourselves. Or something like that.

Homer: Now, who's up for a cold Duff? Quantum mechanics always makes me thirsty.

Homer: Well, shoot. They left without saying anything. Maybe I should've stuck to talking about donuts.
