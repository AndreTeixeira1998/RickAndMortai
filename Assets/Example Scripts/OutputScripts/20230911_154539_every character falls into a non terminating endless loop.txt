Narrator: Prompt By: Mehmet Fırat Aydın
[Rick walks to Morty]
Rick: Morty, I've created something amazing! Get ready for the ultimate adventure!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Oh man, Rick, what did you do now?
Rick: I've invented a time loop device, Morty. With this, we can experience an endless loop of excitement and danger!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, Rick, are you sure this is a good idea? It sounds a bit... risky.
Rick: Risky? Morty, when have I ever played it safe? This is the thrill of a lifetime!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Alright, Rick, I trust you. Let's give it a shot. But if things go wrong, I'm blaming you!
Rick: No worries, Morty. We're in this together. Now, activate the time loop device!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Here goes nothing, Rick!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Alright, Morty, prepare yourself for the ultimate adventure!
Morty: I'm ready, Rick! Let's do this!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Frick, Morty! We're stuck in a time loop!
Morty: Shoot, Rick! How do we get out of this?
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]

Morty: This can't be happening, Rick! We can't escape!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Dammit, Morty! We're trapped in this endless cycle!
Morty: What do we do now, Rick? We can't keep doing this forever!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Son of a... Morty! We're going to be stuck here forever!
Morty: We have to figure something out, Rick! There has to be a way!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: This is a nightmare, Morty! We're never going to escape!
Morty: We can't give up, Rick! There has to be a solution!

Morty: We can't let it break us, Rick! We have to keep fighting!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: I can't take it anymore, Morty! We're doomed to repeat this forever!
Morty: We can't give up, Rick! We have to find a way to break free!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Shoot, Morty! We're stuck in this damn loop!
Morty: We have to think outside the box, Rick! There has to be a solution!
