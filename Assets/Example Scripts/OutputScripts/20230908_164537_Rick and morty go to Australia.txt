Rick: Morty, grab your stuff. We're going to Australia.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Australia? Aww jeez, Rick, why do we need to go there?
Rick: I need to find some Quantum Koala leaves, Morty. Only grows in Australia.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Quantum Koala leaves? What the heck is that, Rick?
Rick: It's a special kind of leaf, Morty, with properties that can bend reality. Really powerful stuff.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Bend reality? That sounds dangerous, Rick.
Rick: Dangerous, but necessary, Morty. Now, let's go.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Back Alley]
Rick: Shoot, this isn't Australia. This is a dodgy back alley.
Morty: Crap, Rick, can't you get anything right?
Rick: Hey, watch it Morty. This thing isn't as easy to control as it looks.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Frick, still not Australia.
Morty: Can't we just take a plane, Rick? This portal stuff is making me dizzy.
Rick: Planes are for simpletons, Morty. We're scientists.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Well, your science isn't working, Rick.
Rick: Alright, Morty, back off. I got this.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Rick: Dang it! This is the Simpsons house, not Australia.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, you're really messing this up.
Rick: Shut up, Morty. One more try.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Rick: This is Shrek's swamp. Frickity frick, Morty, I can't get us to Australia.
Morty: Maybe we should ask Shrek for directions.
Rick: That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard, Morty. Wubba lubba dub dub!
Morty: Well, it's better than nothing, Rick.
Rick: Fine, Morty. Let's ask the stupid ogre.
[Rick walks to Shrek]
Rick: Hey, Shrek, you know how to get to Australia?
Shrek: Sorry, mate. I've never left the swamp.
Rick: Well, frick. Thanks for nothing.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Screw it, Morty. We'll try again tomorrow.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I was actually excited to see Australia.
Rick: Well, Morty, sometimes life is a series of disappointments.
Morty: Yeah, I'm starting to realize that, Rick.
