Rick: Morty, where are you? I can't remember where I put my portal gun!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Right here, Rick. You left it on the workbench.
Rick: Ah, thanks Morty. You know, old age is catching up to me. Frickin' Alzheimer's, always messing with my memory.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: It's okay, Rick. We all forget things sometimes.
Rick: Yeah, but this is different, Morty. It's like my brain is a portal to a dimension where memories go to die.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Shoot, Rick. That sounds rough. Is there anything I can do to help?
Rick: Nah, Morty, it's my burden to bear. Just keep being my trusty sidekick and we'll get through this crap together.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I'm here for you, Rick. No matter what dimension we're in or what challenges we face.
Rick: Thanks, Morty. Now, let's get back to our adventures. I've got a new dimension to explore.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Uh, Rick, are you sure you're up for it? Maybe we should take a break.
Rick: Nonsense, Morty! I may have Alzheimer's, but I still have my genius mind. We can't let this disease hold us back.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Okay, Rick, if you say so. Just promise me you'll take it easy.
Rick: I promise, Morty. Now, let's create a portal and see what awaits us in the unknown.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Frick, Morty. I can't remember why we came out here.
Morty: It's okay, Rick. We just wanted to take a break and enjoy the fresh air.
Rick: Right, right. The fresh air. Let's just sit here and relax for a bit.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Sounds good, Rick. We can just take it easy and enjoy the moment.
Rick: You know, Morty, even with Alzheimer's, I'm lucky to have you by my side.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. That's really sweet of you to say.
Rick: Well, don't get used to it, Morty. I still think you're a little turd half the time.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: That's the Rick I know and love. Wubba lubba dub dub!
Rick: Haha, that's the spirit, Morty. Now, let's head back to the garage and continue our adventures.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Alright, Morty, let's get back to work. We've got a whole multiverse to explore.
Morty: Yeah, Rick, I'm ready for whatever comes our way. Let's kick some interdimensional butt!
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty. Now, let's see if I can remember where I put that portal gun.
