Narrator: Rick and morty talk about how fat chats mum is
Narrator: Prompt By: me
Rick: Morty, you see that over there? Your mom's put on some weight.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, that's not cool. You shouldn't talk about Mom like that.

Rick: Relax, Morty. I'm just stating the obvious. She's been hitting the snacks a little too hard.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Well, maybe she's just stressed, Rick. You know, dealing with all our crazy adventures.

Rick: Stress? Morty, stress doesn't make you eat a whole frickin' cake in one sitting.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Alright, Rick, maybe you're right. But there's no need to be so mean about it.

Rick: Mean? Morty, I'm just speaking the truth. She's got more junk in the trunk than a spaceship junkyard.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: You know, Rick, you're not exactly a model of fitness either.

Rick: Hey, I'll have you know I have a high metabolism, Morty. I can eat whatever the crap I want and not gain an ounce.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Yeah, well, maybe Mom just needs a little support from us instead of your fat-shaming comments.

Rick: Support? Morty, I've been supporting her... with my scientific genius and interdimensional adventures.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: That's not what I meant, Rick. I mean emotional support, like being there for her.

Rick: Emotional support? Morty, I'm a scientist, not a frickin' therapist. I don't do feelings.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: You could at least try, Rick. She's our mom, after all.

Rick: Fine, Morty. I'll try to be a little more sensitive. But don't expect me to start hugging it out or something.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: That's all I'm asking for, Rick. Just a little empathy.

Rick: Alright, alright, I get it. I'll tone down the fat jokes. But only for your sake, Morty.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Thanks, Rick. I appreciate it.

Rick: Now, let's get back to our adventures. We've got a whole multiverse to explore.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Yeah, let's go, Rick. But remember, no fat jokes.

Rick: Got it, Morty. No fat jokes. Now, let's shoot off to another dimension and leave this weighty discussion behind.
