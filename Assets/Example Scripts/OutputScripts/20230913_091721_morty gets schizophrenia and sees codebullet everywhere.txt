Narrator: morty gets schizophrenia and sees codebullet everywhere
Narrator: Prompt By: Kaity Love
Rick: Morty, I need your help with something.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what now?
Rick: I've been working on a new device, Morty. It's supposed to help with... mental health issues.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Mental health issues? Rick, you're not a psychiatrist.
Rick: No, Morty, I'm not. But I am a genius, and this device could potentially cure schizophrenia!
Morty: Schizophrenia? That's a serious condition, Rick. You can't just play around with people's minds like that.
Rick: It's not playing around, Morty. It's science. And besides, I think you might be showing symptoms.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Symptoms? Of schizophrenia? Aww, Rick, you're scaring me.
Rick: Don't be scared, Morty. It's just a hypothesis. But you have been acting odd lately.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Odd? How?
Rick: Well, Morty, you've been talking about seeing CodeBullet everywhere.
Morty: CodeBullet? But that's just a YouTube channel, Rick.
Rick: Yes, Morty, but you're seeing him everywhere. That's not normal.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Oh, shoot, Rick. I don't want to have schizophrenia.
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. We'll use my device and see if it helps.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: I hope it works, Rick.
Rick: It will, Morty. Trust me.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Jerry: Hey guys, what's up?
Rick: Morty might have schizophrenia, Jerry. We're going to try and fix it.
Jerry: Oh, crap. That's serious. Are you sure about this, Rick?
Rick: Yes, Jerry. Now, Morty, stand still.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Rick: Okay, Morty. Let's begin.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: How do you feel, Morty?
Morty: I... I don't know, Rick. I think I need some time to process this.
Rick: That's okay, Morty. Take all the time you need.
Morty: Thanks, Rick.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty. We're in this together.
