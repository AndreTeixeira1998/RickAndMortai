Rick: Morty, I've got a new adventure for us.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez Rick, what is it this time?
Rick: We're going to Shrek's swamp, Morty.
Morty: Shrek's swamp? Why would we go there, Rick?
Rick: Because Morty, there's a rare element there that I need for my science experiments.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Shrek: Well, what do we have here? Donkey, we've got visitors!
Donkey: Oh, shoot! Who are these guys, Shrek?
Rick: We're just here for some science stuff, Shrek. No worries.
Shrek: Science stuff? In my swamp? I don't think so!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. We're in trouble now!
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. I've got this.
[Rick walks to Shrek]
Rick: Shrek, we just need a small sample of the element. It won't harm your swamp.
Shrek: And why should I trust you?
Rick: Because, Shrek, we're scientists. We're not here to cause trouble.
Shrek: Alright, fine. But only a small sample!
Rick: Thanks, Shrek. You're not as bad as they say.
Shrek: Who says I'm bad?
Morty: Uh, nobody, Shrek. Rick's just messing with you.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! Let's get this element and get out of here.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. This was a close call.
Rick: Yeah, Morty. But we got what we came for. Let's head back.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well, Morty, that was a successful trip.
Morty: Yeah, Rick. But next time, can we go somewhere less... swampy?
Rick: We'll see, Morty. We'll see.
