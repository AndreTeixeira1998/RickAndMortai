Narrator: rick and morty discuss topics NOT to feed an AI that generates rick and morty episodes' scripts
Narrator: Prompt By: Dioptre
Rick: Morty, come over here, we need to discuss something important.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, uh, what's up, Rick?
Rick: Morty, we need to talk about what we should never feed to an AI that generates our episode scripts.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: AI that generates what now, Rick?
Rick: Our episode scripts, Morty. It's a machine that can write stories about us. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Oh, oh, okay, Rick. So, what should we not feed it?
Rick: First of all Morty, we shouldn't feed it any information about our personal lives. That's private stuff, Morty.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Yeah, yeah, I get that, Rick. What else?
Rick: We should also avoid giving it any information about our adventures that we haven't gone on yet. We don't want it spoiling the surprise, Morty.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, uh, makes sense, Rick. Anything else?
Rick: Yeah, Morty. We should also avoid feeding it any information about our enemies. We don't want it creating stories where they win.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. That sounds like a lot of stuff we can't tell it.
Rick: Yeah, Morty. But it's for the best. We want to keep our adventures fresh and exciting. Not predictable and boring.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: So, so, how do we make sure we don't feed it the wrong information, Rick?
Rick: Well, Morty, we just have to be careful about what we say and do around it. And remember, it's just a machine. It doesn't have feelings or desires. It's not going to get upset if we don't tell it everything.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. This is a lot to take in.
Rick: Yeah, Morty. But it's important. We want our adventures to be the best they can be.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Alright, Rick. I'll try my best to remember all this.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty. Wubba lubba dub dub!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Can we go on an adventure now?
Rick: Sure thing, Morty. Let's get out of here.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Rick: Frick, we are in Shrek's swamp now, Morty.
Morty: Oh, crap, Rick. This is not what I had in mind.
