Narrator: Rick and morty fight batman
Narrator: Prompt By: me
Rick: Morty, get your ass over here! We've got a problem.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: What's going on, Rick? Why do you look so serious?
Rick: Morty, we've got a new enemy in town. It's Batman!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Batman? Like, THE Batman? The Dark Knight?
Rick: Yeah, Morty, that Batman. He's causing trouble in the multiverse and we need to stop him.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: But, Rick, he's a superhero. Shouldn't we be, like, on his side?
Rick: Morty, Batman may be a hero, but he's also a vigilante. And you know how I feel about vigilantes.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: So, what's the plan, Rick? How do we take down Batman?
Rick: Well, Morty, I've created a device that can neutralize Batman's gadgets. We just need to get close enough to use it.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: How are we gonna do that, Rick? Batman is, like, super stealthy and stuff.
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. I've got a plan. We're gonna lure Batman into a trap using a stolen Bat Signal.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Whoa, Rick! That's pretty risky. What if he gets angry?
Rick: Morty, Batman's got a stick up his butt. He's always angry. Now, help me set up the trap.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Alright, Rick. Let's do this. But, uh, what if we get caught? Batman's got all those crazy gadgets.
Rick: Morty, I've got this under control. Just trust me, okay?
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Okay, Rick. I trust you. Let's catch that Bat-freak!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Alright, Morty, the Bat Signal is set up. Now we just wait for Batman to take the bait.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. This is intense. What if he's too much for us to handle?
Rick: Morty, we're the smartest beings in the multiverse. We can handle anything. Just stay focused.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: I'm trying, Rick, but I can't help but feel like we're in over our heads here.
Rick: Morty, quit being such a wuss. We've faced worse than Batman. Remember that time we fought the Council of Ricks?
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Yeah, but at least they didn't have a utility belt full of gadgets.
Rick: Gadgets? Morty, gadgets are just toys. They can't beat the power of science and intellect.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I hope you're right, Rick. I really do.
Rick: Trust me, Morty. We've got this. Now, stay quiet and keep your eyes peeled for any sign of Batman.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Morty, there he is! Batman has taken the bait.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. This is it. Our showdown with the Caped Crusader.
Rick: Morty, remember, we're not the bad guys here. We're just trying to teach Batman a lesson about playing hero.
Morty: Right, Rick. Let's do this. For science!
Rick: For science, Morty. Now, let's take down the Bat!
[Rick and Morty engage in a fight with Batman, using their gadgets and intellect to outsmart him]
Morty: Take that, Bat-freak!
Rick: Eat science, Batman!
[Morty and Rick successfully defeat Batman]
Morty: We did it, Rick! We beat Batman!
Rick: That's right, Morty. No one messes with us and gets away with it.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: So, what do we do now, Rick? Should we, like, turn him in or something?
Rick: Nah, Morty. Let's just leave him here. He'll wake up with a headache and a lesson learned.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Alright, Rick. Let's get out of here before he wakes up. I don't want any Bat-revenge.
Rick: Good thinking, Morty. Frick Batman and his brooding ways. Let's go home.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Morty: Phew, that was intense, Rick. I can't believe we just fought Batman.
Rick: Yeah, Morty. We've had our fair share of crazy adventures, but this one takes the cake. Wubba lubba dub dub!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Can we please have a normal day now?
Rick: Morty, normal is overrated. Adventure is where it's at. But, hey, if you want to relax and watch TV, we can do that too.
Morty: Really, Rick? You mean it?
Rick: Of course, Morty. Now, let's kick back, relax, and watch some interdimensional cable.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Now that's what I'm talking about, Rick. Let's enjoy the simple things for once.
Rick: Couldn't agree more, Morty. Now, pass me the remote and let's see what crazy shows these other dimensions have to offer.
