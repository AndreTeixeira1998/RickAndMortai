Rick: Morty, get your frickin' butt in here!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what's the emergency this time?
Rick: Emergency? Morty, I just found a new dimension with the best interdimensional cable package. We're talking unlimited channels of pure mind-bending entertainment!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Really, Rick? More interdimensional cable? We've been through this before. Last time, we ended up watching a dimension where people just stare at rocks all day.
Rick: Yeah, well, this time it's different, Morty. This dimension has a channel dedicated to fart jokes. You love fart jokes, Morty!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: I do not love fart jokes, Rick. And even if I did, we have enough weirdness in our lives already.
Rick: Come on, Morty, live a little! We'll just take a quick trip to the Yard and set up the interdimensional cable box. It'll be fun, I promise.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Fine, Rick, but if we end up in some dimension where people eat their own boogers, it's on you.
Rick: Deal, Morty. Now let's create a portal to the Yard and get ready for some mind-numbing entertainment!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Alright, Morty, let's set up the interdimensional cable box right here in the Yard.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: I hope this doesn't take too long, Rick. I still have homework to do.
Rick: Screw homework, Morty! We're about to embark on a journey through the weirdest channels the multiverse has to offer.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Alright, Rick, the cable box is all set up. Let's see what bizarre shows we can find this time.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the SimpsonsHouse]
Rick: Woah, Morty, look at this! We're in the loungeroom of the Simpsons House.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Holy crap, Rick! Are we actually in the world of The Simpsons?
Rick: Yep, Morty. And look, there's Homer, Bart, and Marge. Hey, Simpson family, mind if we join you for some interdimensional cable?
[Homer, Bart, and Marge wave and invite Rick and Morty to sit on the couch]
Homer: D'oh! Welcome to Springfield, guys. Let's see what crazy channels we can find together.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: This is insane, Rick! We're watching interdimensional cable with the Simpsons. Pinch me, I must be dreaming.
Rick: No time for dreaming, Morty. We've got to find the channel with the most hilarious alien stand-up comedians.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Alien stand-up comedians? That sounds interesting. Let's find that channel, Rick.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Rick: Well, Morty, looks like we've ended up in Shrek's Swamp.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Oh boy, Rick. What are we doing here?
Rick: We're here to catch Shrek and Donkey doing their stand-up routine. I heard they're a comedy duo in this dimension.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: That's frickin' hilarious, Rick! Let's find them and enjoy the show.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Starwars Cantina]
Rick: Morty, we've made it to the Star Wars Cantina. Time to find Yoda and Jar Jar Binks for some interdimensional stand-up comedy.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I can't believe we're in the Star Wars universe, Rick. This is unreal!
Rick: It's as real as it gets, Morty. Now let's find Yoda and Jar Jar and have a good laugh.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Back Alley]
Rick: Alright, Morty, we're back in the good ol' back alley. Time to head home and continue our interdimensional cable marathon.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Thank goodness, Rick. I've had enough of jumping through dimensions for one day.
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. We'll be back for more mind-numbing entertainment soon. Wubba lubba dub dub!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I can't wait. But next time, can we just stick to regular cable?
Rick: Regular cable? Morty, that's like asking a genius to watch a reality show. We're way beyond regular cable now.
Morty: Yeah, yeah, I know, Rick. But sometimes, regular can be nice too.
Rick: Well, Morty, if you ever want regular, you can always go back to watching paint dry. But trust me, the multiverse has so much more to offer.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Alright, Rick. I guess I'll embrace the weirdness. Let's head home and continue the interdimensional madness.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Let's go!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
