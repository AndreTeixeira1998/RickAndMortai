Narrator: all the characthers are cursed and can only speak in binary code
Narrator: Prompt By: Doge nel Priv√®
Rick: Morty, I've got a frickin' problem here!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, what's up, Rick? 
Rick: We've been cursed, Morty! We can only speak in binary code!
Morty: Binary code? Aww jeez, Rick, you mean like, zeros and ones? 
Rick: Yes, Morty, zeros and ones! Now, I need you to help me reverse this curse.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Okay, Rick. But how do we do that?
Rick: We need to go to the Simpsons' dimension. They might have a solution.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Rick: Ready, Morty? 
Morty: Shoot, Rick, I guess so.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Homer: Well, well, well, if it isn't Rick and Morty! What brings you to our dimension?
Rick: We've been cursed, Homer. We can only speak in binary code.
Homer: Binary code? D'oh! That's a tough one, Rick.
Bart: I think I can help, man. I've been messing with binary codes in school.
Marge: Bart, this is not the time for your pranks!
Bart: No, seriously mom, I can help. 
Rick: Alright, Bart. We're listening.
[Bart explains his plan]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, this sounds really complicated.
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. We've got this. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Morty, we need to implement Bart's plan. Go to the workbench and bring me the quantum oscillator.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Okay, Rick, but I hope this works.
Rick: It will, Morty. Trust me.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Rick: Alright, Morty. Let's do this.
[They implement Bart's plan and the curse is lifted]
Rick: Ha! We did it, Morty! We're back to normal!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, that was a close one.
Rick: That's the beauty of adventure, Morty. You never know what's going to happen next!
Morty: Yeah, I guess you're right, Rick. But next time, can we avoid the curses?
Rick: No promises, Morty. No promises.
