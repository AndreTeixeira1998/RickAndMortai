Narrator: Prompt By: Asian Thomas
Rick: Morty, I need your help.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, what is it this time, Rick?
Rick: I've...I've got ligma, Morty.
Morty: Ligma? What's ligma, Rick?
Rick: Ligma is a deadly disease, Morty. It's a real serious issue.
Morty: Oh man, Rick, that sounds terrible. What do we do?
Rick: Well, Morty, we need to find a cure. And I know just the place.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Shrek: What are you doing in my swamp, Rick?
Rick: Shrek, I need your help. I've got ligma.
Shrek: Ligma? That's a real serious issue, Rick. You're in luck though, I've got just the thing.
[Shrek walks to Rick]
Shrek: Here, eat this. It's an onion. It's got layers, just like the cure to ligma.
Rick: Are you sure about this, Shrek?
Shrek: Trust me, Rick. I'm an ogre, I know these things.
[Rick walks to Center Stage]
Rick: Alright, here goes nothing.
[Rick eats the onion]
Rick: Oh, frick. That's a strong onion.
Morty: Did it work, Rick?
Rick: I...I think so, Morty. I think I'm cured.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: That's great, Rick! But, uh, can we go home now? This swamp is giving me the creeps.
Rick: Sure thing, Morty. Let's get out of here.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Ah, back home. Feels good, Morty.
Morty: Yeah, Rick. I'm just glad you're okay.
Rick: Me too, Morty. Me too. Wubba lubba dub dub!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. You're still saying that?
Rick: Of course, Morty. It's my catchphrase. It's like my...my signature, you know?
Morty: Yeah, Rick. I know.
Rick: Good. Now, let's get back to work. There's a multiverse out there waiting for us.
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Morty: Aww, crap. Here we go again.
