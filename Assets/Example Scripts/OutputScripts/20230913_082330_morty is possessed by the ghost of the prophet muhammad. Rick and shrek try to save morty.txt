Narrator: Prompt By: universalgleam
Rick: Morty, you're acting strange. What's going on with you?
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I... I don't know, Rick. I feel... different.
Rick: Different? How so, Morty?
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: I feel... powerful, Rick. Like I'm being guided by something... something bigger than me.
Rick: Oh, shoot, Morty. Don't tell me you've been messing with the Ouija board again!
Morty: No, Rick, I swear! I haven't touched that thing since the last time!
Rick: Hmm... we need a second opinion. Let's go to Shrek's swamp. He might know what's happening.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Shrek: What are ye doin' in me swamp, Rick?
Rick: Morty's acting weird, Shrek. We need your help.
[Shrek walks to Morty]
Shrek: Aye, there's somethin' different about ye, lad. Ye smell like... a prophet.
Morty: A prophet? Like... Muhammad?
Shrek: Aye, that's the one. It's like he's in ye.
Rick: Oh, crap. Morty, you're possessed by the ghost of Muhammad.
Morty: What? No way, Rick! That's impossible!
Rick: It's true, Morty. You've got the power of a prophet now.
Morty: So, what does that mean, Rick?
Rick: It means you're powerful, Morty. You're a prophet now. You can do things no one else can.
Morty: Like what, Rick?
Rick: Like... well, I don't know exactly. But it's going to be frickin' awesome, Morty.
Shrek: Careful, Rick. With great power comes great responsibility.
Rick: Yeah, yeah, we know, Shrek. Morty, let's go back to the garage and figure this out.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Alright, Morty. Let's see what you can do with this new power of yours.
Morty: Uh, okay, Rick. I guess I'll give it a try.
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: Here, Morty. Try to move this screwdriver with your mind.
Morty: Alright, Rick. Here goes nothing...
[Rick walks to Morty]
Rick: Holy frick, Morty! You did it! You're a real-life prophet!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. This is... this is amazing. But also kind of scary.
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. We'll figure this out together. Wubba lubba dub dub!
