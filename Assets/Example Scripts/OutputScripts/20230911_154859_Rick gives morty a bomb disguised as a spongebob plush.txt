Narrator: Rick gives morty a bomb disguised as a spongebob plush
Narrator: Prompt By: Sleepy
Rick: Morty, come here! I've got something you're gonna love.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. What is it this time?
Rick: Take a look at this, Morty. It's a SpongeBob plush!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Uh, Rick, why are you showing me a SpongeBob plush? I'm not a kid anymore.
Rick: Morty, Morty, Morty. This isn't just any ordinary SpongeBob plush. It's a bomb, Morty! A bomb disguised as SpongeBob SquarePants!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: What? Are you serious, Rick? You can't just give me a bomb!
Rick: Relax, Morty. It's not a real bomb. It's just a harmless detonation device. I've programmed it to shoot confetti when you press its belly.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Shoot confetti? Why would I want to do that, Rick?
Rick: Morty, it's all about the element of surprise. Imagine handing this innocent-looking plush to someone, and then BAM! Confetti explosion right in their face. It's a prankster's dream, Morty.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: I don't know, Rick. It seems a little dangerous. What if it accidentally explodes?
Rick: Morty, trust me. I'm a genius. I've taken all the necessary precautions. This thing is foolproof. Just make sure not to press the belly too hard, or else it might turn into an actual bomb. But who would be dumb enough to do that, right?
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: I don't know, Rick. This seems like a bad idea. What if someone gets hurt?
Rick: Morty, Morty, Morty. You worry too much. It's all in good fun. Besides, it's not like anyone's gonna mistake a SpongeBob plush for a real bomb. They'd have to be a total idiot, Morty.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. But I still don't feel comfortable with it.
Rick: Fine, Morty. If you're too scared to have some fun, I'll just keep the SpongeBob bomb for myself. I'm sure Jerry would appreciate it.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: No, no, no! I'll take it, Rick. I don't want Jerry getting his hands on it. Just promise me it won't explode for real.
Rick: I promise, Morty. Now, go out there and prank the world with that SpongeBob bomb!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Morty: Alright, here goes nothing. I'm gonna prank Jerry with this SpongeBob bomb.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Hey, Dad! Look what I got for you!
Jerry: Oh, wow! A SpongeBob plush! Thanks, Morty. You know, I've always been a big fan of SpongeBob.
[Morty walks to Yard]
Morty: Just press its belly, Dad. It's a special surprise.
Jerry: Well, alright then. Here goes nothing.
[Jerry presses the plush's belly and confetti shoots out]
Jerry: What the frick! Morty, what did you do?!
Morty: It's just a harmless prank, Dad. No need to get all worked up.
Jerry: Morty, I thought it was a bomb! You scared the crap out of me!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: See, Rick? I told you this was a bad idea. I could've seriously hurt someone.
Rick: Relax, Morty. It's all part of the fun. Jerry's fine, and we got a good laugh out of it. That's what matters.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. But next time, let's stick to pranks that won't give my dad a heart attack, okay?
Rick: Fair enough, Morty. But remember, sometimes you gotta take risks to have a little fun. That's the beauty of life, Morty.
Morty: Yeah, I guess you're right, Rick. Life's all about taking risks and having adventures.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Now, let's go find another dimension to explore. Adventure awaits!
