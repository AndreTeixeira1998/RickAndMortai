Narrator: Prompt By: Dioptre
Rick: Yo, yo, Morty! Check this, uh, frickin' gadget.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Rick, don't tell me it's another uh, uh, interdimensional doohickey.
Rick: No, Morty, it's straight fire! It's a beatbox, Morty!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: A beatbox, Rick? Really? What's the point?
Rick: The point, Morty, is to spit them bars. You ready, Morty?
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Spit bars? Rick, I'm not a rapper.
Rick: Well, Morty, you're about to be. Let's do this.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the SimpsonsHouse]
Homer: Whoa, who are you guys?
Rick: We're the illest rappers in the multiverse, that's who.
Bart: Prove it!
[Rick walks to Center Stage]
Rick: Aight, check this. Yo, I'm Rick and I'm slick, travel through dimensions so quick. Interdimensional travel ain't no trick, got my portal gun, it's so sick.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I don't know if I can do this.
Rick: Come on, Morty. Spit them bars!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, uh, I'm Morty, not sporty, my grandpa's Rick, he's forty. We travel through dimensions, it's a hobby, always getting into trouble, it's our story.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! That was fire!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I didn't know I had it in me.
Rick: Of course, Morty. You're a natural. Now, let's get back to our usual interdimensional shenanigans.
Morty: Yeah, yeah, Rick. But can we do something normal for once?
Rick: Normal, Morty? We're beyond normal. We're the illest rappers in the multiverse!
Morty: Aww shoot, Rick. I guess you're right.
Rick: Of course, I'm right, Morty. Now, let's get back to our adventures. Wubba lubba dub dub!
