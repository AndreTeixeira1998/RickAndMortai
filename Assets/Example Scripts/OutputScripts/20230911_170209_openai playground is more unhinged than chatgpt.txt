Rick: Morty, get your sorry ass over here! I've made a groundbreaking discovery.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Oh boy, Rick. What did you do this time?
Rick: Strap in, Morty. I've invented a device that can manipulate time itself!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Whoa, Rick! Are you telling me we can time travel now?
Rick: That's right, Morty. We can go back in time and fix all our past mistakes. No more awkward encounters or embarrassing moments.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Geez, Rick. That sounds amazing. But won't messing with time have serious consequences?
Rick: Consequences, schmonsequences, Morty! With my genius, we can handle anything that comes our way.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I don't know, Rick. Remember when we accidentally turned the whole world into Cronenberg monsters?
Rick: That was just a minor setback, Morty. We can learn from our mistakes and make things right.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Alright, Rick. Let's give it a shot. But if anything goes wrong, I'm holding you responsible.
Rick: Fair enough, Morty. Let's fire up the time machine and take a trip to the past!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Back Alley]
Rick: Frick, Morty. We overshot the mark. We're in some dodgy back alley.
Morty: Shoot, Rick. How do we get back?
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. I'll recalibrate the coordinates and get us home in no time.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Alright, Morty. We're back in the garage. Time to test the time machine.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I'm getting nervous.
Rick: Relax, Morty. It's just a little time travel. What could go wrong?
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Famous last words, Rick. Let's just hope we don't accidentally erase ourselves from existence.
Rick: Trust me, Morty. We'll be fine. Now, let's set the time machine to five minutes ago and see what happens.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Alright, Rick. Here goes nothing.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the past]
Rick: Look around, Morty. Everything seems the same. The time machine worked perfectly!
Morty: Wow, Rick. This is incredible. We can fix all our mistakes and make our lives perfect.
Rick: Hold on, Morty. We need to be careful. Changing the past can have unintended consequences.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: You're right, Rick. We shouldn't mess with things too much. Let's just enjoy this moment and appreciate what we have.
Rick: Wise words, Morty. Sometimes, it's better to leave the past in the past and focus on the present.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: I couldn't have said it better myself, Rick.
Rick: Well, Morty, it looks like we've learned a valuable lesson today. Time travel may be tempting, but it's important to appreciate the here and now.
Morty: Absolutely, Rick. Let's make the most of our current reality and embrace the adventures that await us.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty. Wubba lubba dub dub!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. You always know how to keep things interesting. Let's go on another crazy adventure soon.
Rick: You got it, Morty. The universe is our playground, and we're just getting started!
