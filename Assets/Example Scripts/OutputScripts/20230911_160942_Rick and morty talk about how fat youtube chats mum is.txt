Narrator: Rick and morty talk about how fat youtube chats mum is
Narrator: Prompt By: me
Rick: Morty, get over here! You won't believe what I found on the interdimensional web.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what did you stumble upon this time?

Rick: It's a live stream, Morty. And guess what? It's your mom's cooking show!

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: My mom's cooking show? That's not so bad, right?

Rick: Oh, it's bad, Morty. It's real bad. These YouTube chat comments are tearing her apart.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: What do you mean, Rick? What are they saying?

Rick: Let me read you some of these gems, Morty. "Shoot, that's one big mama! She must have eaten the whole galaxy!" And here's another one, "Crap, I've seen planets smaller than her!"

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: That's not fair, Rick! They shouldn't be so mean!

Rick: Welcome to the internet, Morty. It's a jungle out there. But don't worry, I've got a plan.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: What's the plan, Rick?

Rick: We're going to hack into the live stream and give those trolls a taste of their own medicine. We'll show them what real cooking is all about!

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Are you sure about this, Rick? Won't it make things worse?

Rick: Trust me, Morty. We'll turn this troll fest into a culinary masterpiece. And maybe, just maybe, we'll teach them a lesson about respect.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Alright, Rick. Let's do it. Let's show them what my mom's cooking is all about!

Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Let's hack into the stream and give those YouTube commenters a run for their money!

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]

Rick: Alright, Morty, fire up the cooking equipment. It's time to show the world what we've got!

Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I hope this works. My mom deserves better than those mean comments.

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]

Rick: Don't worry, Morty. We'll make sure those trolls eat their words. Now, let's get to work!

Morty: Yeah, let's show them that my mom's cooking can't be beat!

Rick: That's the spirit, Morty. Together, we'll cook up a storm and shut those haters up for good!

Morty: You know, Rick, sometimes it feels good to prove people wrong.

Rick: Absolutely, Morty. It's all about standing up for what you believe in and showing the world what you're made of.

Morty: And what we're made of is one hell of a cooking duo!

Rick: Damn right, Morty! Now, let's get cooking and serve up a big plate of shut-the-hell-up to those YouTube trolls!

Morty: I'm with you, Rick. Let's do this!

[They start cooking and the garage fills with delicious aromas as they prepare a feast fit for kings.]

Narrator: And so, Rick and Morty turned the tables on the YouTube trolls, proving that fat-shaming and cyberbullying have no place in their world. With their culinary skills and determination, they showed the power of standing up for what's right, even in the face of online negativity. And as they enjoyed the delicious meal they had prepared, they knew that sometimes, the best revenge is a mouth-watering dish served with a side of justice.
