Narrator: Rick teaches Morty how to please a woman
Narrator: Prompt By: JiJi
Rick: Morty, I think it's time we had a talk.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, a-a talk, Rick? What about?
Rick: About women, Morty. Specifically, how to please them.
Morty: Aw jeez, Rick, I don't know if I'm ready for that kind of talk.
Rick: Nonsense, Morty! You're a young man now. It's time you learned.
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: You see, Morty, women aren't like us. They're complex, multi-dimensional beings. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Multi-dimensional? Like, like they exist in more than one dimension at a time?
Rick: No, Morty, not literally multi-dimensional. I mean they have depth, they have layers. 
[Rick walks to Center Stage]
Rick: And to please a woman, Morty, you have to understand those layers. You have to be attentive, patient, and considerate.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Attentive, patient, considerate. Got it, Rick.
Rick: Good. Now, let's practice. Pretend I'm a woman you're trying to impress.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, okay, Rick. Uh, hey there, uh, lady. You, uh, you look nice today.
Rick: Not bad, Morty. But remember, flattery will only get you so far. You have to show genuine interest in her as a person.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Right, right. Show interest. Got it.
[Rick walks to Morty]
Rick: And remember, Morty, no means no. If she's not into it, you back off. No questions asked.
Morty: Of course, Rick. I'm not a creep.
Rick: Good. Just making sure, Morty. Now, let's move on to the physical stuff.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Physical stuff? Aw jeez, Rick, I'm not sure I'm ready for that.
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. I'm not going to get graphic. Just remember, always be gentle and make sure she's comfortable.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Gentle, comfortable. Got it, Rick.
Rick: Good. Now, let's practice some more. 
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Now, remember Morty, this is just practice. Don't get all weird about it.
Morty: I won't, Rick. I promise.
Rick: Good. Now, let's get to work. Wubba lubba dub dub!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. This is going to be one heck of a day.
