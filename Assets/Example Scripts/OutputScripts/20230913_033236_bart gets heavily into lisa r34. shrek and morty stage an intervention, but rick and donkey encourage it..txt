Narrator: Prompt By: gsfsb693
Rick: Morty, we got a call from the Simpsons' dimension. Something about Bart.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww, geez, Rick. What's he done now?
Rick: He's gotten heavily into Lisa R34. 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, uh, Rick, you mean like...adult stuff? With his own sister?
Rick: That's right, Morty. And it's up to us to sort it out.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Re, re, really, Rick? We're going to intervene in someone else's dimension?
Rick: Not just us, Morty. We're bringing Shrek and Donkey along for this one.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Shrek and Donkey? This is gonna be a frickin' mess, Rick.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! Let's get this over with.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Bart: What the hell, Rick and Morty? And Shrek and Donkey? What are you guys doing here?
Morty: Bart, we're here to talk about your...uh...interest in Lisa R34.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Shrek: That's right, lad. It's not healthy to be into that sort of thing, especially with your own sister.
Donkey: Yeah, Bart! It's just plain weird!
Rick: Actually, I think it's quite interesting. Shows a complex understanding of the human psyche.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Rick, you're not helping!
Rick: What? I'm just saying it's fascinating from a scientific perspective.
Morty: Aww, crap, Rick. Can't you be serious for once?
Donkey: Yeah, Rick! This ain't no time for jokes!
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, everyone! Let's just let Bart do what he wants.
Bart: Thanks, Rick. You're the only one who gets it.
Morty: Aww, shoot, Rick. This is a mess.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well, Morty. That was a disaster.
Morty: Yeah, Rick. A real frickin' disaster.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! Let's just forget this ever happened.
Morty: Yeah, Rick. Let's just forget.
