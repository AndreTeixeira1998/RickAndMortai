Rick: Morty, get your butt in here! I've been scammed on eBay!

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what happened?

Rick: I bought a brand new 4090TI graphics card, Morty. But when it arrived, it was a frickin' fake!

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Shoot, Rick. How did you fall for that?

Rick: Hey, don't blame me, Morty. The seller had a high rating and everything. It looked legit!

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Well, what are we gonna do now, Rick?

Rick: We're gonna track down that scammer, Morty. We're gonna teach him a lesson he'll never forget!

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Uh, Rick, isn't that a bit extreme? Can't we just get a refund or something?

Rick: Refund? Morty, this guy needs to learn that he can't mess with Rick Sanchez!

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Alright, Rick, what's the plan?

Rick: We're gonna use my interdimensional tracking device to locate the scammer's hideout. Then, we'll pay him a little visit.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Uh, Rick, are you sure this is a good idea? What if things get out of hand?

Rick: Morty, when has anything ever gone according to plan? But that's the beauty of it, Morty. The unexpected is where the real adventure lies!

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. Let's go get that scammer!

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]

Rick: Alright, Morty, let's fire up the interdimensional tracking device. We're gonna find that scammer and give him a taste of his own medicine!

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: I hope this works, Rick. I don't want things to get too crazy.

Rick: Don't worry, Morty. We'll handle this like professionals. Now, let's track down that son of a crap!

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Back Alley]

Rick: Alright, Morty, this is the place. Keep your guard up.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Uh, Rick, this place gives me the creeps. I don't like it.

Rick: Relax, Morty. We're just here for some justice. We'll be in and out in no time.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: I hope you're right, Rick.

Rick: Alright, let's knock on this scammer's door and give him a little surprise.

[Rick and Morty knock on the door]

Scammer: Who's there?

Rick: It's your worst nightmare, you scamming frick!

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Yeah, you thought you could mess with Rick Sanchez? Think again!

[Scammer opens the door]

Scammer: What the hell are you guys talking about?

Rick: You know damn well what we're talking about! You sold me a fake 4090TI, you piece of crap!

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Yeah, and now you're gonna pay for it!

Scammer: Look, I'm sorry, okay? I needed the money. I'll give you a refund, I promise!

Rick: It's too late for apologies, buddy. You messed with the wrong genius.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Yeah, prepare to face the consequences of your actions!

[Rick and Morty grab the scammer and drag him into the portal to the Garage]

Rick: Alright, Morty, let's make sure this guy never scams anyone again.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: What are we gonna do, Rick?

Rick: We're gonna give him a taste of his own medicine, Morty. We're gonna scam the scammer!

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Uh, Rick, isn't that a bit hypocritical?

Rick: Hypocritical? Morty, I'm just teaching him a lesson. It's called poetic justice.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. Let's show him what we're made of!

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the SimpsonsHouse]

Rick: Alright, scammer, prepare to meet your worst nightmare!

[Marge walks into the room]

Marge: Oh my, who are you people?

Rick: We're here to teach this scammer a lesson, Marge. He messed with the wrong genius.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Yeah, and now he's gonna pay!

Marge: Well, I don't condone violence, but I understand the need for justice. Let's show him the consequences of his actions.

[Rick, Morty, and Marge confront the scammer]

Scammer: Please, I'll do anything! Just let me go!

Rick: Anything? Alright, you're gonna refund everyone you scammed and then disappear. Got it?

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Yeah, and if we ever catch you scamming again, it won't end well for you.

Scammer: Alright, alright, I promise! Just please, let me go!

[Rick, Morty, and Marge leave the scammer in the SimpsonsHouse and enter the portal to the Garage]

Rick: Well, Morty, justice has been served. That scammer won't be causing any more trouble.

Morty: I guess sometimes you gotta fight fire with fire, huh, Rick?

Rick: That's right, Morty. And remember, never mess with Rick Sanchez!

Morty: Yeah, I learned my lesson. Let's hope that scammer did too.

Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! Adventure awaits us, as always.
