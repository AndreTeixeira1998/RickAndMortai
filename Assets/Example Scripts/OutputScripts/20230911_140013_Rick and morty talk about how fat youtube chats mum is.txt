Narrator: Rick and morty talk about how fat youtube chats mum is
Narrator: Prompt By: me
Rick: Morty, you won't believe what I saw on the interdimensional internet today.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Uh, what is it, Rick?

Rick: It's this video of YouTube chats mom. She's gotten frickin' fat!

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Oh man, Rick, that's not cool. You shouldn't be body-shaming people.

Rick: Morty, I'm not body-shaming, I'm just stating the facts. She's put on some serious weight.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Well, it's not nice to make fun of someone's appearance, Rick. It's just not cool.

Rick: Alright, Morty, fine. I won't make fun of YouTube chats mom's weight anymore. Happy now?

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Yeah, I am. We should all be more respectful and considerate of others, no matter what they look like.

Rick: Shoot, Morty, you're right. I shouldn't have said those things. It's important to treat people with kindness and respect.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: That's what I'm talking about, Rick. We should focus on spreading positivity and uplifting others instead of tearing them down.

Rick: You know what, Morty? You're absolutely right. Let's use our adventures to make a positive impact in the multiverse.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: That's the spirit, Rick! We can use our scientific knowledge and abilities to help people and make the world a better place.

Rick: Crap, Morty, I never thought I'd say this, but you've really grown into a compassionate and empathetic young man.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Thanks, Rick. I've learned a lot from you, and I want to use that knowledge to make a difference.

Rick: Well, Morty, I'm proud of you. Let's go out there and do some good in the world. Wubba lubba dub dub!

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Wubba lubba dub dub, Rick! Let's show the multiverse what we're capable of!

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]

Rick: Frick, Morty, we've got a lot of work to do. Let's get started!

Morty: Yeah, Rick! Adventure awaits us, and this time, we're going to make a positive impact!
