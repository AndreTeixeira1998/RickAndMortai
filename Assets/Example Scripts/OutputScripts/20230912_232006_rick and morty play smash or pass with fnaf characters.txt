Narrator: Prompt By: Shortyboio
Rick: Morty, get your butt over here and help me sort out this mess!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what is it this time?
Rick: We're going to play Smash or Pass, Morty. And not with any ordinary characters, but with Five Nights at Freddy's characters.
Morty: Uh, uh, are you serious, Rick? Those animatronics are creepy!
Rick: That's the fun part, Morty! Now grab the cards and let's start.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Okay, first up is Freddy Fazbear.
Rick: Pass! That bear is a fricking nightmare!
Morty: Alright, Rick. What about Foxy?
Rick: Smash! That pirate fox has some style.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww, man, Rick. You're really into this, huh? Next is Chica.
Rick: Pass! That chicken gives me the creeps.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Bonnie?
Rick: Smash! That rabbit has some serious guitar skills.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Okay, last one. Golden Freddy.
Rick: Pass! That bear is too fricking mysterious for my taste.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I can't believe we just did that.
Rick: Well, Morty, it's all in good fun. Now let's clean up this mess.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Yeah, yeah. I'll clean up. 
Rick: Good boy, Morty. Now, let's see what other games we can play. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Can we just watch some interdimensional TV, Rick?
Rick: Sure, Morty. But remember, the universe is full of infinite possibilities. Even playing Smash or Pass with animatronics.
Morty: Yeah, yeah. I get it, Rick. Let's just watch some TV.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty!
