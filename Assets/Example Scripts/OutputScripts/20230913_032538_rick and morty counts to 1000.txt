Rick: Morty, come over here.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: What's up, Rick?
Rick: I've got a challenge for you, Morty. 
Morty: Challenge? Uh, uh, what kind of challenge, Rick?
Rick: We're going to count to 1000, Morty.
Morty: Count to 1000? Aww jeez, Rick, why would we do that? 
Rick: Why not, Morty? It's a mental exercise. Keeps the brain sharp.

Rick: Well, Morty, we can spice it up a bit. For every wrong count, you owe me a favor.
