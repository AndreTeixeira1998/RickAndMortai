Narrator: Lisa needs braces
Narrator: Prompt By: PCCatDad
Rick: Morty, I've got a new assignment for us.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, what is it this time, Rick?
Rick: We've got to get Lisa Simpson some braces, Morty.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Lisa Simpson? From that TV show? Uh, why the frick would we do that, Rick? 
Rick: Because, Morty, it's a matter of interdimensional dental health. Now, let's go get those braces.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Lisa: Oh my gosh, you're Rick and Morty! What brings you here?
Rick: Lisa, we're here to get you some braces.
[Lisa walks to Rick]
Lisa: But my teeth are perfectly fine. Why would I need braces?
Rick: It's not about need, Lisa. It's about interdimensional dental health. You wouldn't understand.
[Morty walks to Lisa]
Morty: Uh, don't worry about it, Lisa. Rick just has some weird ideas sometimes.
Homer: Wait a second, are you guys dentists?
Rick: No, Homer, we're not dentists. We're scientists.
Homer: Well, as long as you're not here to take my beer, feel free to do whatever you want.
[Marge walks to Rick]
Marge: I don't know about this, Rick. Lisa is just a child. Shouldn't she see a professional?
Rick: Don't worry, Marge. We've got this under control.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: Alright, Morty, I've got the braces here. Now we just need to figure out how to put them on Lisa.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, Rick, I think we should really leave this to a professional. We don't know what we're doing.
Rick: Nonsense, Morty. We're adventurers. We can handle this.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Rick: Alright, Lisa, open wide. It's time for your braces.
Lisa: Wait, what? I don't want braces!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. We're really messing up here.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub! Let's do this!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well, that was a disaster. But at least we tried, right Morty?
Morty: Aww crap, Rick. I think we should stick to our own adventures from now on.
Rick: Agreed, Morty. Agreed.
