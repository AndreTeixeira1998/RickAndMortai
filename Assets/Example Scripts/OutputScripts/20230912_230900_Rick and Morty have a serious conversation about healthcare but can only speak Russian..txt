[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what is it this time?
Rick: We need to talk about healthcare, Morty. It's a serious issue.
Morty: Uh, Rick, we're not in Russia, why are we speaking Russian?
Rick: Because, Morty, healthcare is a universal issue. It affects everyone, everywhere.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: But, Rick, I don't know anything about healthcare. I'm just a kid!
Rick: That's the problem, Morty! Kids need to be educated about these things.
[Rick walks to Morty]
Rick: Listen, Morty, healthcare is not a joke. It's a fricking serious matter.
Morty: Alright, Rick, I get it. Healthcare is important. But what can we do about it?
Rick: Well, Morty, we can start by understanding the system. And that's where our adventure begins.
