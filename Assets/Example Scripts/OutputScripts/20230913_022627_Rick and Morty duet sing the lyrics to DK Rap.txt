Narrator: Prompt By: Matty1406
Rick: Morty, we're going to sing a classic, the DK Rap.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, uh, DK Rap? You mean from Donkey Kong 64, Rick?
Rick: That's the one, Morty! It's a classic.

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]

Rick: Here we go, Morty. Let's show the Simpsons how it's done.
Morty: Okay, Rick. You start.

Rick: (singing) So they're finally here, performing for you. If you know the words, you can join in too!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, uh, (singing) Put your hands together, if you want to clap. As we take you through this monkey rap!

Homer: (laughs) This is great, Marge!
Marge: I've never seen anything like it, Homey!

Rick: (singing) Huh! DK! Donkey Kong! He's the leader of the bunch, you know him well. He's finally back to kick some tail!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: (singing) His coconut gun can fire in spurts. If he shoots ya, it's gonna hurt!

Bart: (laughs) This is the best thing ever!

Rick: (singing) He's bigger, faster, and stronger too. He's the first member of the DK crew!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: (singing) Huh! DK! Donkey Kong! DK! Donkey Kong is here!

Rick: (singing) This Kong's got style, so listen up dudes! She can shrink in size, to suit her mood!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: (singing) She's quick and nimble when she needs to be. She can float through the air and climb up trees!

Rick: (singing) If you choose her, you'll not choose wrong. With a skip and a hop, she's one cool Kong!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: (singing) Huh! DK! Donkey Kong!

Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! We nailed it!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I think I need a break.

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]

Rick: Well, Morty, that was a fun little detour. Now, back to our sci-fi shenanigans!
Morty: Yeah, Rick. That was, uh, uh, really something.
