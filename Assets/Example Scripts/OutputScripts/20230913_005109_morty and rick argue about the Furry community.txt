Narrator: morty and rick argue about the Furry community
Narrator: Prompt By: ZirrowtheFox
Rick: Morty, we need to talk.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh-oh, this doesn't sound good. What is it, Rick?
Rick: It's about the furry community, Morty.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, not this again. Why do you care so much about that?
Rick: Because, Morty, it's a fascinating anthropological phenomenon. People dressing up as animals and interacting with each other. It's a whole new level of social interaction.
Morty: But, Rick, it's just people having fun. Why does it matter to you?
Rick: Morty, everything matters to me. Especially when it involves people behaving in strange and unusual ways.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Well, I think it's kind of cool. They're just expressing themselves, Rick.
Rick: Expressing themselves? Morty, they're dressing up as animals and pretending to be them. It's weird.
Morty: You're just saying that because you don't understand it, Rick.
Rick: No, Morty, I understand it perfectly. It's just strange to me.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Well, maybe you should try it out, Rick. Maybe you'd understand it better if you experienced it for yourself.
Rick: Me? Dress up as an animal? Morty, that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
Morty: Well, you never know, Rick. You might like it.
Rick: Morty, I'm not going to dress up as a furry. That's just not going to happen.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Fine, Rick. But don't knock it until you've tried it.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty. I don't need to try it to know it's not for me.
Morty: Well, at least you're open-minded, Rick.
Rick: Yeah, Morty, I'm a real fricking paragon of open-mindedness.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Can't we just agree to disagree on this?
Rick: Alright, Morty. We'll agree to disagree. But only because I don't feel like arguing about it anymore.
Morty: That's fair, Rick. Let's just drop it.
Rick: Fine by me, Morty. Now, let's get back to work.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty. The universe isn't going to explore itself.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Can't we just take a break for once?
