Narrator: yoda and rick explain STDs to morty in gen Z terms
Narrator: Prompt By: Industrial Dishwasher
Rick: Morty, get over here! I've got something important to talk about.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, what is it now, Rick?
Rick: We need to talk about STDs, Morty.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Are you serious?
Rick: Yes, Morty, I'm fricking serious. It's a real issue, especially for your generation.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, okay Rick. But why are we talking about this now?
Rick: Because Morty, knowledge is power. And I don't want you to be an ignorant little frick.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Alright, I guess. So, what's the deal with STDs?
Rick: Well, Morty, STDs are diseases that you can get from having unprotected sex. They can cause all sorts of problems, like itching, burning, and even more serious stuff.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: That sounds pretty bad, Rick. 
Rick: It is, Morty. But there's someone else here who can explain it better than I can.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Starwars Cantina]
Rick: Yoda, we could use your wisdom on this matter.
Yoda: Mmm, STDs, a serious matter they are. To prevent them, protection you must use.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, protection? You mean like condoms, right?
Rick: That's right, Morty! Condoms are one of the best ways to prevent STDs.
Yoda: Mmm, correct you are, Rick. But remember, not just physical protection, mental protection too, you must have.
Morty: Uh, mental protection? What does that even mean, Yoda?
Yoda: To make wise decisions, you must. Not just in the heat of the moment, but always. To think before you act, important it is.
Rick: Yoda's right, Morty. You've got to be smart about these things. Don't just jump into bed with anyone.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. This is a lot to take in.
Rick: I know it is, Morty. But it's important. Wubba lubba dub dub!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I'll try to remember all of this.
Rick: That's all I ask, Morty. Now let's get out of this crap hole.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Morty: Thanks, Rick. I think I understand now.
Rick: Good, Morty. Remember, your health is important. Don't frick it up.
Morty: I won't, Rick. I promise.
Rick: That's my boy, Morty. Now, let's get back to our adventures.
