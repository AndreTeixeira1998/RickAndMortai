Rick: Morty, get over here. I've got something you need to see. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, what is it, Rick?
Rick: It's Code Bullet's search history, Morty. 
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Code Bullet? Isn't that the guy who makes those uh, programming videos on YouTube?
Rick: That's the one, Morty. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: So, uh, what's so interesting about his search history?
Rick: Well, Morty, it's what he's not searching for that's interesting. 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Not searching for? I don't understand, Rick. 
Rick: Exactly, Morty. You wouldn't understand. But let's just say, it's a little bit unusual. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Unusual how, Rick?
Rick: Well, Morty, let's just say he's not searching for how to make a perfect cup of coffee. 
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Are you saying he doesn't know how to make coffee?
Rick: No, Morty. I'm saying he doesn't care about making the perfect cup of coffee. He's too busy searching for other things. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Like what, Rick?
Rick: Like how to create a self-learning AI that can beat any video game, Morty. 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Whoa, that's pretty cool, Rick. 
Rick: It's more than cool, Morty. It's frickin' amazing. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: So, uh, what are we going to do with this information, Rick?
Rick: Well, Morty, we're going to use it to our advantage. 
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Advantage? How, Rick?
Rick: You'll see, Morty. You'll see. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I'm not sure I like where this is going. 
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. It's all part of the adventure.
