Narrator: Rick and the narrator rap battle
Narrator: Prompt By: Kieranlw98
Rick: Alright, Narrator, you think you're so slick. Let's see how you handle a real Rick rap attack.
[Narrator: Rick begins to beatbox]
Rick: Yo, I'm Rick, I'm slick, I'm quick, I'm thick with the wit, don't give a frick. 

Narrator: Well, I'm the Narrator, I'm greater, I'm later, I'm the ultimate debater, I'm the story creator.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, Rick, are you sure you want to do this? The Narrator's pretty good.

Rick: Shut up, Morty! I've got this. Yo, Narrator, you're a traitor, a hater, an imitator, I'll see you later. 

Narrator: And I'm the Narrator, the instigator, the life animator, I'm not the hater, I'm the curator. 

[Rick walks to Center Stage]
Rick: Shoot, Narrator, you're just a spectator, an elevator, a second-rater, I'm the generator, the motivator.

Narrator: Well, Rick, you're the perpetrator, the agitator, the desecrator, I'm the moderator, the terminator.

[Rick walks to Morty]
Rick: Crap, Morty, I think he's got me beat. 

Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, I could've told you that. This is the Narrator we're talking about.

Rick: Shut up, Morty! I've still got one more verse. Yo, Narrator, you're the violator, the investigator, the isolator, I'm the originator, the innovator.

Narrator: And I'm the Narrator, the vindicator, the illuminator, I'm not the violator, I'm the liberator.

[Rick walks to Center Stage]
Rick: Well, frick, Narrator. I guess you win this one. 

Narrator: Indeed, Rick. But let's not forget, without you, there would be no story to narrate. 

Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, I guess you're right. Let's call it a draw, Narrator. 

Narrator: Agreed, Rick. Until next time. 

[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, Rick, can we do something less intense now?

Rick: Sure thing, Morty. Let's go watch some interdimensional cable.
