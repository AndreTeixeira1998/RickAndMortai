Narrator: rick and morty complains about being stuck on a menu for 3 and a half hours.
Narrator: Prompt By: Belug
Rick: Morty, get over here!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: What is it, Rick?
Rick: I've been stuck on this frickin' menu for three and a half hours, Morty! 
Morty: Uh, re-re-really, Rick? A menu? 
Rick: Yes, Morty, a menu! It's for the interdimensional cable box. I can't figure it out.

[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Let me see, Rick. Maybe I can help.
Rick: Be my guest, Morty. But I swear, if you fix it in two seconds, I'm going to lose my crap.

[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Okay, Rick. Let's see...you just have to press this button here. 

Rick: What button, Morty? 
Morty: This one, Rick. The one that says "select."

[Rick walks to Morty]
Rick: Are you frickin' kidding me, Morty? Three and a half hours! 

Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I'm sorry. It was just a button. 

Rick: Just a button, Morty? That's three and a half hours I could have spent doing...uh...important stuff!

[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, Rick. It's not that big of a deal. We can watch interdimensional TV now.

Rick: Morty, you don't understand. Those three and a half hours...they're gone, Morty. Gone forever!

[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Okay, Rick. I get it. I'm sorry. Can we just watch TV now?

Rick: Fine, Morty. Wubba lubba dub dub, let's watch some frickin' TV. 

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]

Marge: Oh, hello Rick and Morty. Are you here to watch some TV?
Rick: Yes, Marge. We've been trying to figure out how to do it for three and a half hours.
Homer: D'oh! That's rough, Rick. Well, make yourselves at home.
Morty: Aww jeez, thanks, Homer.

[Rick and Morty return to the Garage]
Rick: Well, that was a waste of time. Let's just watch some regular TV, Morty.
Morty: Yeah, Rick. I think that's a good idea.
Rick: Good. Now pass me the remote, Morty. I don't want to get stuck on another menu.
