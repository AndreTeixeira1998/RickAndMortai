Narrator: Rick and Morty argue about what is the tastiest part of a human baby
Narrator: Prompt By: Ihor Yashchenko
Rick: Morty, get over here! We need to talk.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, uh, what's up, Rick?
Rick: Morty, what do you think is the tastiest part of a human baby?
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, that's a horrible question! Why would you even ask that?
Rick: It's a hypothetical question, Morty. We're not actually going to eat a baby.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Well, uh, I guess the cheeks would be the softest part, right? 
Rick: Morty, you're fricking disgusting. I was obviously talking about the brain. It's the most nutrient-dense part.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Brain? That's even worse, Rick! That's like, cannibalism or something!
Rick: It's not cannibalism if it's a hypothetical question, Morty.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: This is messed up, Rick. Can't we just talk about something else?
Rick: Fine, Morty. Let's talk about the ethics of eating a sentient creature then.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: That's still pretty messed up, Rick.
Rick: Well, shoot Morty, life's messed up. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. You really know how to ruin a day.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Embrace the existential dread.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Can we just go to another dimension or something? I need a distraction from this conversation.
Rick: Sure, Morty. Let's go to the Simpsons' house. Maybe they can lighten the mood.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Rick: Hey Homer, Morty here thinks the tastiest part of a baby is the cheeks.
Homer: D'oh! That's ridiculous. Everyone knows it's the brain!
Morty: Oh, crap. Not you too, Homer!
