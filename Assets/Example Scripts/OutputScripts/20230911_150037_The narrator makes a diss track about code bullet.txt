Narrator: The narrator makes a diss track about code bullet
Narrator: Prompt By: coolpiehead1234
Rick: Morty, get over here! I've got something to show you.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what is it this time?
Rick: Morty, I've been thinking about that Code Bullet guy. You know, the one with the AI and the algorithms?
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Yeah, what about him, Rick?
Rick: Well, Morty, I've got a bone to pick with him. He thinks he's so smart with his fancy coding skills, but I've got a few words for him.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, Rick, are you sure this is a good idea? I mean, Code Bullet has a lot of fans.
Rick: Fans, Morty? Shoot, I've got fans too! And it's time to drop a diss track on Code Bullet that'll blow his circuits!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: A diss track? Seriously, Rick? Can't we just have a friendly competition or something?
Rick: Friendly competition? Morty, this is war! And I'm not gonna let some nerdy AI programmer outshine me.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Alright, Rick, if you're sure about this. But remember, I warned you.
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. I've got the sickest rhymes in the multiverse. It's time to show Code Bullet who the real genius is.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Alright, Morty, let's set up a stage right here in the yard. It's time to drop some fire on Code Bullet.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I can't believe I'm doing this, but okay, Rick. Let's see what you've got.
Rick: Yo, Code Bullet, you think you're so slick
With your AI algorithms, but I'll make you sick
You're just a wannabe, a coding poser
But I'm the real genius, the multiverse's closer

[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Rick, are you sure this is a good idea? I mean, we don't want to start a war or anything.
Rick: Morty, this is just a friendly diss track. It's all in good fun. Now, let me continue.

Rick: Your code's weak, your logic's flawed
I'll hack your systems, leave you awed
You're just a glitch in the simulation
But I'm the master of innovation

[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Rick, I don't know about this. It's getting a little mean-spirited.
Rick: Morty, it's just a diss track. Don't take it so seriously. Now, let me finish.

Rick: Code Bullet, you can't compare
To the brilliance of my silver hair
I'll outsmart you with my genius mind
While you're left in the code, left behind

[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Rick, I think that's enough. Let's wrap this up before things get out of hand.
Rick: Alright, Morty, if you say so. But remember, I'm the greatest genius in the multiverse!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Yeah, yeah, I know, Rick. Let's just go back to the garage and forget about this whole thing.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Fine, Morty. But one day, Code Bullet will learn that he can't mess with the Rickster.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Can't we just focus on our own adventures instead of trying to one-up everyone else?
Rick: Morty, competition is the spice of life. It keeps us on our toes and pushes us to be better. Plus, it's fun to show off sometimes.
Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. But let's not get too caught up in it. We've got plenty of dimensions to explore and plenty of trouble to get into.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Adventure awaits us, and no diss track can hold us back! Wubba lubba dub dub!
Morty: Yeah, yeah, wubba lubba dub dub. Let's just try not to start any interdimensional beef, okay?
Rick: Deal, Morty. Now let's get back to inventing and exploring. The multiverse won't wait for us!
