Rick: Morty, grab your coat! We're going on an adventure.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, Rick, where are we going this time?
Rick: We're going to a galaxy far, far away, Morty. 
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Starwars Cantina]
Yoda: Hmm, visitors we have, yes.
Rick: Quiet, Yoda. We're here for a reason.
Jar Jar Binks: Mee-sa glad to see you, Rick!
Rick: Oh, shoot, not you again, Jar Jar.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, Rick, why are we here again?
Rick: We're here to get some space ale, Morty. Best in the galaxy.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: But, uh, Rick, don't we have some at home?
Rick: Not like this, Morty. This ale is brewed from the tears of a thousand space worms. 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, that sounds disgusting.
Rick: Trust me, Morty, it's delicious.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: So, uh, are we going to drink this now?
Rick: No, Morty, this is for a special occasion.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: What occasion, Rick?
Rick: The occasion of me wanting to drink it, Morty. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, you're so weird.
Rick: And yet you continue to follow me, Morty. What does that say about you?
Morty: Uh, I guess it says I'm, uh, loyal?
Rick: Sure, Morty. Let's go with that.
