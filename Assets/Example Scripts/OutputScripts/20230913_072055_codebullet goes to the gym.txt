Narrator: codebullet goes to the gym
Narrator: Prompt By: Quinnobi 42
Rick: Morty, we need to get in shape. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. You're talking about going to the gym, aren't you?
Rick: That's right, Morty! We're going to the gym. 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: But Rick, I don't even know how to work out. 
Rick: That's why I'm here, Morty. I'm going to guide you.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Back Alley]
Rick: Welcome to the gym, Morty.
Morty: This is a back alley, Rick. This isn't a gym.
Rick: In the multiverse, Morty, anywhere can be a gym. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww crap, Rick. I'm not sure about this.
Rick: Quit your whining, Morty. Let's get to it. First, we're going to do some push-ups.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Push-ups? Uh, Rick, I don't think I can do a push-up.
Rick: You can, Morty. You just need to believe in yourself.
Morty: Alright, Rick. I'll give it a try.
Narrator: Morty attempts to do a push-up but struggles.
Rick: Keep going, Morty. You're doing great.
Morty: I'm not so sure, Rick. This is hard.
Rick: No pain, no gain, Morty.
Morty: Aww frick, Rick. This is too much.
Rick: You can do it, Morty. Just a few more.
Narrator: Morty collapses on the ground, exhausted.
Rick: Good job, Morty. You did it.
Morty: I did? I really did it, Rick?
Rick: Yes, Morty. You did. Now, let's get back to the garage and get some rest.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! You survived your first workout.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I'm beat. But I guess it wasn't so bad.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Now, let's get some rest. We have another workout tomorrow.
Morty: Tomorrow? Aww shoot, Rick.
