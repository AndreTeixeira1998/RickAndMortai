Narrator: rick and morty discovers that code bullet is out of touch and then tell everyone
Narrator: Prompt By: xtremxd
Rick: Morty, get over here! I've made a shocking discovery!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what is it now?
Rick: It's about Code Bullet, Morty. He's out of touch with reality!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Out of touch? What do you mean, Rick?
Rick: I mean, Morty, Code Bullet's algorithms are stuck in the Stone Age. He's using outdated coding techniques!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Shoot, Rick! That's not good. What should we do?
Rick: We need to let everyone know, Morty. We can't let them fall victim to subpar coding practices.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Alright, Rick, but how do we do that?
Rick: We'll create a portal to the internet, Morty. We'll spread the word far and wide!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Whoa, that's intense, Rick! But, uh, won't that cause chaos?
Rick: Chaos? Morty, chaos is my middle name! Besides, it's for the greater good of the coding community.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Okay, if you say so, Rick. Let's do it!
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! That's the spirit! We're about to shake up the coding world!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Internet]
Rick: Alright, Morty, time to expose Code Bullet's outdated techniques!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: But, Rick, won't people get mad at us for calling him out?
Rick: Morty, people need to know the truth. It's better to face the wrath of the coding community than to live in ignorance.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. Let's spread the word!
Rick: Crap, Morty! Look at all these angry programmers. They're really passionate about their code!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Yeah, Rick, they're not holding back. But hey, at least we're making a difference!
Rick: Frick yeah, Morty! We're shaking things up, one line of code at a time.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I never thought I'd be a code warrior, Rick. It's kinda cool.
Rick: It's more than cool, Morty. It's a revolution! We're fighting for the future of coding!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: You're right, Rick. And we won't stop until Code Bullet updates his algorithms!
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty. We're on a mission to bring modern coding practices to the masses!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I never thought I'd be part of something so important.
Rick: Well, Morty, sometimes the most unexpected adventures lead to the greatest impact. Now let's keep spreading the word!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Let's do it, Rick! Together, we'll revolutionize the coding world!
Rick: Frick yeah, Morty! Shoot for the stars and code like there's no tomorrow!
