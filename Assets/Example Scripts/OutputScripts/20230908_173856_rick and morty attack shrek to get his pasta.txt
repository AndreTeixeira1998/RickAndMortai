Rick: No, Morty. I want Shrek's pasta. It's the best in the multiverse.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Shrek's pasta? You mean we're going to his swamp?
Rick: Yes, Morty. We're going to the swamp.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Shrek: Oi, what are you doing in my swamp?
Rick: Shrek, we're here for your pasta.
Shrek: My pasta? Over my dead body!
Rick: That can be arranged.
Donkey: Now, now, let's not get hasty. There's enough pasta for everyone.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I didn't sign up for this.
Rick: Too late, Morty. We're in this now.
[Rick walks to Shrek]
Rick: Shrek, give us the pasta or face the consequences.
Shrek: You're bluffing.
Rick: Am I, Shrek? Am I really?
Shrek: I won't be threatened in my own swamp!
[Rick walks to Center Stage]
Rick: Fine, Shrek. Have it your way.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]

Morty: Rick, that was intense. Are we really going to attack Shrek?
Rick: Yes, Morty. We're going to get that pasta one way or another.
