Narrator: Rick and morty fight batman
Narrator: Prompt By: me
Rick: Morty, get your frickin' butt over here! I've got something important to discuss.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what is it this time? I was just trying to watch TV.
Rick: Well, Morty, forget about TV for a second. We've got a serious problem on our hands.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: What's the problem, Rick? Did you break something again?
Rick: No, Morty, it's worse than that. Batman has somehow entered our dimension, and he's causing havoc in the city!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: What? Batman? How did he even get here, Rick?
Rick: I don't know, Morty. But we can't just sit around and let him wreck everything. We need to stop him before it's too late.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: But, Rick, we're just two regular guys. How are we supposed to take on Batman?
Rick: Morty, we may not have superpowers, but we've got something betterâ€”our wits and a portal gun. We can outsmart him.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Alright, Rick, if you say so. But how do we even find Batman? He could be anywhere.
Rick: That's where the portal gun comes in, Morty. We'll create a portal to Gotham City and track down the Dark Knight.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Gotham City? Isn't that dangerous, Rick?
Rick: Of course it's dangerous, Morty! But we can handle it. We've faced worse threats than a billionaire in a bat suit.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. Let's teach Batman a lesson he won't forget.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty. Let's show him what happens when you mess with Rick and Morty!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Gotham City]
Rick: Alright, Morty, keep your eyes peeled. Batman could be lurking anywhere.
Morty: Yeah, yeah, I'm on it, Rick. Just don't get us killed, okay?
Rick: Relax, Morty. I've got this under control. Now let's find that caped crusader and give him a taste of our dimension-hopping skills.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Rick, look! There he is! Batman, over there!
Rick: Good eye, Morty. Let's go show him who's boss.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Batcave]
Rick: Well, well, well, Batman. Fancy meeting you here.
Batman: Who are you two? And how did you find my secret lair?
Rick: We're Rick and Morty, and let's just say we have a knack for finding things. Now, why don't you explain why you're causing trouble in our dimension?
Batman: I'm here on a mission, and I won't let anyone get in my way.
Morty: Aww jeez, Batman, can't we just talk this out? Maybe we can find a peaceful resolution.
Batman: I don't negotiate with amateurs. Prepare to face justice.
Rick: Justice, huh? Well, we've got a different idea of justice, Batman. Morty, it's time to show him what we're made of.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Alright, Batman, get ready to be defeated by the power of science!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Batmobile]
Rick: Morty, take the wheel! It's time to give Batman a taste of his own Batmobile.
Morty: Shoot, Rick, I've never driven anything like this before!
Rick: Just focus, Morty. We've got this. Now, let's give Batman a chase he won't forget.
[Morty drives the Batmobile, chasing Batman]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, I can't believe we're actually doing this.
Rick: Frick, Morty, this is what being an adventurer is all about. Now, step on it!
[Morty accelerates, catching up to Batman]
Morty: Alright, Batman, time to face the music!
Rick: Morty, use the portal gun to create a portal in front of Batman. Let's see how he handles a little interdimensional surprise.
[Morty creates a portal, causing Batman to crash into it]
Batman: What the crap? Where am I?
Rick: Looks like Batman got a taste of his own medicine, Morty. Let's leave him there to contemplate his actions.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Yeah, serves him right. Maybe he'll think twice before causing trouble in our dimension again.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty. Now, let's head back home and catch the latest episode of "Interdimensional Cable."
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! Another adventure successfully completed.
Morty: Yeah, Rick. It's always a wild ride with you. But can we please take a break from fighting superheroes for a while?
Rick: Sure thing, Morty. But don't worry, there's always something new and exciting waiting for us in the multiverse.
