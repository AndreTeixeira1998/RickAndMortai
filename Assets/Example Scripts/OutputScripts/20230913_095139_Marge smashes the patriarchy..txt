Narrator: Prompt By: Vladimír Žák
Rick: Morty, I've got something important to show you.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, uh, what is it, Rick?
Rick: We're going to visit the Simpsons, Morty. 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: The Simpsons? Rick, are you sure this is a good idea? 
Rick: Trust me Morty, this is going to be a real eye-opener.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Marge: Well, hello there, Rick and Morty, what brings you here?
Rick: We're here to observe, Marge. To learn.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. What are we learning about?
Rick: The patriarchy, Morty. You see, Marge here is a symbol of the fight against it.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Wha-what? Marge, is this true? 
Marge: Oh, absolutely. I've been fighting the patriarchy for decades now. 
Rick: See, Morty? This isn't just a show about a yellow-skinned family. There's a deeper message here.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: So, Marge, how do you do it? How do you fight the patriarchy?
Marge: Well, Morty, it's not easy. But you have to stand up for yourself, and never let anyone belittle you because you're a woman. 
Rick: That's some real wisdom, Marge. Morty, I hope you're taking notes.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I am, Rick, I am. This is really eye-opening. 
Rick: Good, Morty. Now, let's head back. We've got our own battles to fight.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: So, Morty, what did you learn today?
Morty: I learned that even in a cartoon world, there are real issues being fought.
Rick: That's right, Morty. Wubba lubba dub dub! 
Morty: Yeah, wubba lubba dub dub, Rick. Let's go smash some patriarchy.
