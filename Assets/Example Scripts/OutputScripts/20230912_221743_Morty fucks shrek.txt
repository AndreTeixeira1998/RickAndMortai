Narrator: Morty fucks shrek
Narrator: Prompt By: me
Rick: Morty, grab your stuff. We're going on another adventure.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, Rick, where are we going this time?
Rick: We're going to a place where fairy tales come to life, Morty.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Shrek: What are you doing in my swamp?
Rick: Relax, Shrek. We're just passing through.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. It's the real Shrek.
Rick: Yes, Morty. It's the real Shrek. Now, don't freak out.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Hey, Shrek, big fan. Love your movies.
Shrek: Well, thank you, lad. It's not often I get visitors who aren't trying to evict me.
Donkey: Or marry you!
[Shrek walks to Center Stage]
Shrek: Donkey, not now.
Rick: So, Shrek, we're looking for a magical artifact. Have you seen anything out of the ordinary?
Shrek: Hmmm, now that you mention it, there was this strange glowing rock that fell into my swamp yesterday.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. That sounds like the thing we're looking for.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! That's exactly what we're looking for.
[Shrek walks to Workbench]
Shrek: Here it is, fellas. Found it while I was out fishing.
Rick: Perfect, Shrek. You've been a big help.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Morty: So, Rick, what's this artifact for?
Rick: It's for a science thing, Morty. Don't worry your little head about it.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I hope it's nothing dangerous.
Rick: Dangerous? Morty, when have I ever put us in danger?
Morty: Well, there was that one time with the giant space worm...
Rick: Okay, okay, Morty. Point taken. But trust me, this time it's completely safe. Wubba lubba dub dub!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I hope you're right.
Rick: Morty, when am I ever wrong?
Morty: Uh, Rick, do you really want me to answer that?
Rick: No, Morty. I don't. Now, let's get to work.
