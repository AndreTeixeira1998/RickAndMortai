Narrator: Everyone speaks backwards even narrator!
Narrator: Prompt By: Kacper XT
Rick: Morty, I've got a new gadget. It's a reverse speech translator!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, Rick, that sounds really confusing. 
Rick: Nonsense, Morty! It's genius! With this, we can understand anyone who speaks backwards.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Are there a lot of people speaking backwards?
Rick: Of course, Morty. Haven't you heard of the Backwards Dimension?
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Back Alley]
Narrator: Rick and Morty find themselves in a dodgy back alley where everyone speaks in reverse.
Rick: See, Morty? Everyone here speaks backwards. Let's try the translator.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: This is re-re-really weird, Rick. 
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. Just say something and the translator will reverse it.
Morty: Okay, Rick. Here goes nothing. "Hello, we come in peace."
Rick: Excellent, Morty! Now let's see if they understand us.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, Rick. I think they're angry. They're coming towards us.
Rick: Frick, Morty! I think the translator is malfunctioning! 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I told you this was a bad idea!
Rick: Don't panic, Morty. We just need to get back to the Garage and fix the translator.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Okay, Morty. Let's fix this thing and get back out there.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: I hope you know what you're doing, Rick.
Rick: Of course, Morty. I always know what I'm doing. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Alright, Rick. Let's give it another shot.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Back Alley]
Rick: Let's try this again, Morty. "Hello, we come in peace."
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, Rick. I think it worked. They're not attacking us.
Rick: See, Morty? I told you it would work. Now let's explore this backwards world!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. This is going to be one heck of an adventure.
