Rick: Morty, I've got something to show you. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what is it this time?
Rick: It's a portal to Gotham City, Morty. We're gonna meet the Batman. 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Batman? Are you serious, Rick? Isn't he just a fictional character?
Rick: Fictional in our dimension, Morty. But in another, he's as real as you and me.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: This is too much, Rick. I mean, meeting Batman? That's frickin' insane!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Back Alley]
Narrator: Rick and Morty land in a dark, grungy alley. Suddenly, a figure emerges from the shadows. It's Batman. 
Batman: Who are you? 
Rick: I'm Rick and this is Morty. We're from another dimension. 
Batman: Another dimension? What are you doing here?
Rick: We wanted to meet you, Batman. We're fans. Well, Morty is. 
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Don't embarrass me in front of Batman. 
Batman: I see. Well, it's not every day I meet interdimensional travelers. 
Rick: Yeah, it's not every day we meet a guy dressed as a bat either. 
Batman: I'm not just a guy in a bat costume. 
Rick: Yeah, yeah, we know. You're Batman. You're broody. You're mysterious. You're a little bit of a drama queen. 
Batman: I am not a drama queen. 
Morty: Aww crap, Rick. You've upset Batman. 
Rick: Oh shoot, I'm so scared. What's he gonna do? Brood at me?
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well, that was fun, wasn't it Morty? 
Morty: I guess so, Rick. But I think we upset Batman. 
Rick: Eh, he'll get over it. Wubba lubba dub dub!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I don't think we should have done that. 
Rick: Relax, Morty. It's all in a day's work for us. Now, let's get back to some real science. 
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Yeah, sure Rick. As long as we don't meet any more superheroes. 
Rick: No promises, Morty. No promises.
