Narrator: Rick reads out Code Bulletâ€™s search history.
Narrator: Prompt By: Genesis
Rick: Morty, come over here, I've got something to show you.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. What is it now?
Rick: I've managed to hack into Code Bullet's search history. 
Morty: Code Bullet? Isn't he that YouTuber who does the programming stuff?
Rick: That's the one, Morty. And you wouldn't believe what he's been searching.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Uh, uh, let me guess, Rick. Lots of programming stuff, right?
Rick: Well, yes, Morty. But there's more.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: More? Like what?
Rick: Let's see here. "How to make a quantum computer out of a toaster." "Is it possible to program a black hole?" "Can you download more RAM?" 
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. This guy sounds like a real piece of work. 
Rick: You're not wrong, Morty. But wait, there's more.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: More? Aww crap.
Rick: "How to hack into NASA." "Can you program a wormhole?" "Is time travel possible with Python?" 
Morty: This is getting ridiculous, Rick. 
Rick: Oh, it gets better, Morty. "How to make a portal gun with JavaScript." 
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Wait, what? A portal gun? Like ours? 
Rick: Yeah, Morty. Looks like Code Bullet is trying to get on our level.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: But, uh, uh, can he really do that, Rick? 
Rick: Ha! Good luck to him, Morty. It takes more than code to make a portal gun. It takes a fricking genius. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Well, Rick, I guess we better keep an eye on this Code Bullet guy. 
Rick: Yeah, Morty. We'll keep an eye on him. But for now, let's get back to our own adventures.
