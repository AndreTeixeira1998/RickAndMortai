Narrator: Rick and morty go to Australia
Narrator: Prompt By: me
Rick: Morty, get over here! I've got a new portal destination lined up for us.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, where are we going this time?
Rick: We're headed down under, Morty. We're going to Australia!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Australia? What's so special about Australia, Rick?
Rick: Well, Morty, besides being the land of kangaroos and Vegemite, Australia is also home to some of the most dangerous creatures on Earth.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Dangerous creatures? Like what, Rick?
Rick: Oh, you know, Morty. Giant spiders, venomous snakes, drop bears. It's like a real-life episode of "Crikey! It's the Irwins."
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Great, Rick. Just great. We're gonna get eaten alive by some deadly creature.
Rick: Relax, Morty. I've got it all figured out. I've developed a special repellent that will keep us safe from those pesky critters.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Really, Rick? You've got a repellent for everything, don't you?
Rick: You bet your frickin' ass, Morty. I'm a genius, remember?
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Alright, Rick. Let's see this repellent in action. I don't want any creepy crawlies getting near me.
Rick: Alright, Morty. Stand still. I'm gonna spray you with the Aussie Critter Repellent.
[Morty stands still as Rick sprays him]
Morty: Ugh, this stuff smells like kangaroo poop, Rick!
Rick: Yeah, well, it's either that or becoming a spider's snack, Morty. Take your pick.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Fine, Rick. Let's just get this over with. Open the portal to Australia already.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Australia]
Rick: Crikey, Morty! We made it to Australia!
Morty: Shoot, Rick. It's hotter than Satan's butthole out here.
Rick: Yeah, Morty. Australia can get pretty frickin' hot. That's why they have all those barbies and cold beer.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Cold beer sounds good right about now, Rick. Let's find a pub or something.
Rick: Good idea, Morty. But first, we need to find some kangaroos. I wanna have a boxing match with one of those buggers.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Are you serious, Rick? You wanna fight a kangaroo?
Rick: Hell yeah, Morty! It'll be like Rocky Balboa vs. Kangaroo Dundee. It's gonna be epic!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Alright, Rick. Let's find a kangaroo and get this over with. But if I get punched in the face, it's on you.
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. I'll be right there with you. And if things get hairy, we can always portal outta here.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Yeah, I guess that's comforting. Let's go find those kangaroos, Rick.
[Rick and Morty venture into the Australian outback, searching for kangaroos to box with]
