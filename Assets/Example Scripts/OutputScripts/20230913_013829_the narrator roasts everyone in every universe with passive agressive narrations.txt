Narrator: the narrator roasts everyone in every universe with passive agressive narrations
Narrator: Prompt By: The Cat Brat
Rick: Morty, we've got to get to the workbench! There's something I need to show you.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, okay Rick. What is it this time?
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: It's a new gadget, Morty. It's a universal translator. It can translate any language in any universe!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: That sounds pretty cool, Rick. But, uh, why do we need it?

Narrator: Because Rick is a genius and Morty is just a kid who doesn't understand the complexity of interdimensional communication. Or maybe Rick just likes to show off his inventions. Who knows?

Rick: We need it, Morty, to communicate with aliens who don't speak English. Now, let's test it out.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Starwars Cantina]

Narrator: Ah, the Star Wars Cantina. An intergalactic dive bar filled with the most diverse range of species in the galaxy. Or at least, the most diverse group of extras in rubber masks that the production budget could afford.

Yoda: Hmm, Rick and Morty, welcome you are.
Jar Jar Binks: Mesa so happy to see yousa!

Rick: See, Morty. The translator works perfectly. Now we can understand these Star Wars characters without needing subtitles.

Narrator: Yes, because understanding Jar Jar Binks is definitely a priority for everyone.

Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. This is really cool, but can we go home now?

Narrator: Of course, Morty wants to go home. The kid can't appreciate the beauty of a Star Wars cantina. A real shame.

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! That was a successful test.
Morty: Yeah, Rick. It was pretty cool. 

Narrator: And so, another day in the multiverse ends. Rick, always inventing. Morty, always complaining. And me, always narrating. Shoot, I need a vacation.

Rick: Alright, Morty. Let's call it a day.

Narrator: A day. There, I called it. Happy now, Rick? You insufferable genius. 

Morty: Aww jeez, I could use a break too.

Narrator: Yeah, Morty. We all could. But alas, the show must go on. Until next time, folks. Stay fricking tuned.
