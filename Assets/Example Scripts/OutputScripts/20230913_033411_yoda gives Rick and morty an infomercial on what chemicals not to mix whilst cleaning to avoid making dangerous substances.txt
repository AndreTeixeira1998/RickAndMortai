Narrator: yoda gives Rick and morty an infomercial on what chemicals not to mix whilst cleaning to avoid making dangerous substances
Narrator: Prompt By: James Ball
Rick: Morty, we've got to clean up this garage. It's an absolute mess.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, Rick, can't we just use some of your crazy inventions to clean up?
Rick: No, Morty, sometimes you've got to do things the old-fashioned way.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, I don't even know what half of these chemicals are.
Rick: That's why we're going to consult an expert, Morty.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Starwars Cantina]
Yoda: Welcome, Rick and Morty, you are. Teach you about cleaning, I will.
Rick: Shoot, Yoda, we don't need a lecture. Just tell us what not to mix.
Yoda: Impatient, you are. Dangerous, that can be.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, Yoda, we just don't want to blow anything up.
Yoda: Understand, I do. Mix bleach and ammonia, you must not.
Rick: Yeah, yeah, we know that one. Creates toxic gas, it does. Anything else?
Yoda: Mix vinegar and bleach, you should not. Toxic chlorine gas, it produces.
Morty: Aww crap, Rick, I didn't know that.
Rick: Well, Morty, that's why we're here. Anything else, Yoda?
Yoda: Two-part epoxy and hardener, mix in the correct ratio, you must. Or else, a sticky mess, you will have.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, what's two-part epoxy, Rick?
Rick: It's a type of adhesive, Morty. Very strong, but can be a pain if you screw it up.
Yoda: Wise you are, Rick. Finally, mix different brands of paint thinner, you should not. Different formulas, they have. Ruin your paint job, they could.
Rick: Alright, Yoda, we got it. Thanks for the tips.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, this is going to be a lot of work.
Rick: Well, Morty, at least we won't blow ourselves up. Now let's get to it. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Alright, Rick, let's do this.
