[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. That's not good. What happened?
Rick: I'm not sure Morty, but I have a hunch. 
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: I think it might have encountered an underwater alien civilization. 
Morty: Uh, re re really, Rick? An underwater alien civilization?
Rick: Yeah, Morty. It's not as far-fetched as you might think. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: So, what do we do, Rick?
Rick: We're going to find it, Morty. We're going to find the Oceangate Submersible.

Shrek: What are you doing in my swamp?
Rick: We're not here for your swamp, Shrek. We're here for your knowledge. 
Morty: Yeah, uh, we need to find a missing submersible.
Shrek: A submersible, you say? I might be able to help.

[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. This is some heavy stuff. 
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. We've handled worse. Wubba lubba dub dub!
