Narrator: Prompt By: Kelvin Warren
Rick: Morty, have you seen this Code Bullet guy on YouTube?

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Yeah, Rick, I've seen him. He's a programmer, right?

Rick: That's right, Morty. But here's the thing, his viewers think he sucks at coding.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Really? But he seems pretty knowledgeable to me.

Rick: Well, Morty, sometimes people just don't appreciate real talent. It's like they're stuck in their own little coding bubble.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: So, what are you saying, Rick? That Code Bullet is actually good at coding?

Rick: Absolutely, Morty. He's got some serious skills. But his viewers just can't see it. They're too busy nitpicking every little mistake he makes.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Shoot, that's unfair. He puts so much effort into his videos.

Rick: That's right, Morty. And it's not just about the coding itself. Code Bullet knows how to entertain his audience too.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Yeah, he's got that quirky sense of humor. It's what makes his videos so enjoyable.

Rick: Exactly, Morty. He combines coding knowledge with comedy, and that's a rare talent.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: So, what can we do about it, Rick? Can we help him?

Rick: Well, Morty, we could create a portal to his dimension and show him some support. Let him know that we appreciate his coding skills.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: That's a great idea, Rick! Let's give him a boost of confidence.

Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! That's the spirit. Let's show Code Bullet that he's got fans who believe in him.

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Code Bullet's dimension]

Rick: Hey, Code Bullet! We just wanted to let you know that you're frickin' awesome at coding!

Code Bullet: Wait, what? You guys think I'm good at coding?

Morty: Absolutely, Code Bullet! Your videos are informative and entertaining. Don't let the haters get you down.

Code Bullet: Wow, thanks guys. I really appreciate the support. It means a lot coming from you.

Rick: No problem, Code Bullet. Keep doing what you're doing, and remember, haters gonna hate, but you just keep coding.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Yeah, don't let the negativity crap on your passion. You're a talented programmer, and we believe in you.

Code Bullet: Thanks, Rick and Morty. You guys are the best. I'm gonna keep coding and entertaining my viewers like never before!

Rick: That's the spirit, Code Bullet! Shoot for the stars and show the world what you're capable of.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Yeah, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Keep coding, keep creating, and keep being awesome.

[Rick and Morty enter the portal back to their dimension]

Rick: Well, Morty, I think we made a difference today. We showed Code Bullet that he's got fans who appreciate his coding skills.

Morty: Yeah, Rick, it feels good to support someone who deserves it. Let's keep spreading positivity in the coding community.

Rick: Absolutely, Morty. Let's continue to inspire and uplift those who are passionate about what they do.
