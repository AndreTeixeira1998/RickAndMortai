Narrator: Morty is gay and in love with Rick. OMG
Narrator: Prompt By: Francesco Bustreo
Rick: Morty, get your ass over here!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what's up?
Rick: Morty, I've been doing some thinking, and I think it's time we address the elephant in the room.
Morty: Uh, what elephant, Rick?
Rick: Morty, I know you've been feeling some kind of way lately. And I think I know why.
Morty: What are you talking about, Rick?
Rick: Morty, it's clear as day. You're in love with me.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: What?! No, Rick, that's ridiculous! I'm not in love with you!
Rick: Oh, come on, Morty. I've seen the way you look at me. Your eyes sparkle like a shooting star.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Rick, you're my grandfather! This is messed up!
Rick: Morty, love knows no boundaries. It transcends time, space, and even family ties.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: This is insane, Rick! I can't believe you're saying this!
Rick: Look, Morty, I'm not saying we should act on these feelings. But I think it's important for us to acknowledge them and move forward.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I can't believe I'm hearing this. This is like some messed up sci-fi soap opera.
Rick: Morty, love is a powerful force. It can make us do crazy things. But it's important to remember that we have a mission, and that's to explore the multiverse and have amazing adventures together.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Rick, I don't even know what to say. This is just...wow.
Rick: Look, Morty, I'm not asking you to change who you are. I just want you to know that I accept you for who you are, no matter what.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Thanks, Rick. That means a lot. But can we please never talk about this again?
Rick: Deal, Morty. Now, let's get back to our usual adventures and forget this ever happened.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Agreed, Rick. Let's go find some crazy interdimensional trouble to get into.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Frick, Morty, I forgot to mention we have company in the yard. Jerry's out there.
Morty: Shoot, Rick. I don't want him to find out about any of this.
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. Our secret is safe with me. Let's just act like nothing happened.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Okay, Rick. Let's just focus on the adventure at hand and forget about everything else.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty. Now let's go and show Jerry how real adventurers do it.
