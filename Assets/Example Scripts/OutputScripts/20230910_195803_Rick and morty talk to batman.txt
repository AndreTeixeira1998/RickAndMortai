Narrator: Rick and morty talk to batman
Narrator: Prompt By: me
Rick: Morty, get over here! I've made contact with another dimension!

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what did you do this time?

Rick: Relax, Morty, it's not a big deal. I just stumbled upon Batman's dimension.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Batman? Like the Dark Knight Batman?

Rick: That's right, Morty. The one and only Caped Crusader. I thought it'd be interesting to have a chat with him.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: But Rick, isn't Batman a fictional character?

Rick: Well, technically, Morty, but in the multiverse, fiction and reality can blur. Now, let's see what this Batman has to say.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Alright, Rick, but if anything goes wrong, I'm blaming you.

Rick: Fair enough, Morty. Let's give Batman a call.

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Batman's dimension]

Rick: Hey, Batman, it's Rick and Morty here!

Batman: Who are you two? How did you enter the Batcave?

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Uh, sorry about that, Batman. We're just a couple of interdimensional travelers.

Batman: Interdimensional travelers? That's a new one. What do you want from me?

[Rick walks to Morty]

Rick: We just wanted to have a little chat, Batman. You know, exchange some scientific knowledge.

Batman: I'm not interested in your scientific mumbo jumbo. I have Gotham to protect.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Come on, Batman, don't be a party pooper. We just want to learn from you.

Batman: Fine, but make it quick.

[Rick walks to Morty]

Rick: Alright, Batman, here's a question for you. How do you deal with all those villains?

Batman: It's simple. I use my intellect, gadgets, and martial arts skills to outsmart and defeat them.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: That's pretty cool, Batman. But don't you ever get tired of all the crime-fighting?

Batman: It's a never-ending battle, but someone has to protect the innocent.

[Rick walks to Morty]

Rick: Well, Batman, I have to say, you're doing a frickin' great job. Keep up the good work.

Batman: Thank you, I appreciate that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]

Morty: Well, Rick, that was interesting. Talking to Batman was pretty cool.

Rick: Yeah, Morty, he's a real hero. Just like us, but without the portals and all.

Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I don't think we're heroes.

Rick: Well, Morty, we may not wear capes, but we're out there, exploring the unknown, making a difference in the multiverse.

Morty: Yeah, I guess you're right, Rick. We're like the heroes of science and adventure.

Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Wubba lubba dub dub!

Morty: Wubba lubba dub dub, Rick! Let's keep doing what we do best.

[They both share a laugh as they continue their interdimensional adventures.]
