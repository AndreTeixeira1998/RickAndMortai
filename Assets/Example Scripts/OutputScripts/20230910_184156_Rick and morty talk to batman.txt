Narrator: Rick and morty talk to batman
Narrator: Prompt By: me
Rick: Morty, get over here! I've made contact with another dimension!

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, who is it this time?

Rick: It's Batman, Morty! The Dark Knight himself!

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Batman? Holy crap, Rick! What's he doing here?

Rick: I don't know, Morty, but he's got some serious gadgets. Let's go talk to him.

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]

Rick: Hey, Batman! Long time no see!

[Batman walks to Rick and Morty]

Batman: Rick Sanchez, Morty Smith. What brings you to Gotham City?

[Morty walks to Batman]

Morty: Uh, hi Batman. We were just curious about your crime-fighting skills and stuff.

Batman: Well, I appreciate your interest, but I'm a little busy tonight.

[Rick walks to Batman]

Rick: Busy? What could be more important than hanging out with the smartest guy in the multiverse?

Batman: Saving innocent lives, Rick. Something you should try sometime.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Rick, maybe we should let Batman do his thing. He's a hero, after all.

Rick: Fine, Morty. Let's go back to the garage.

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]

Rick: Shoot, Morty! I thought Batman would be up for some interdimensional adventures.

Morty: Yeah, Rick. But maybe he's got enough on his plate with Gotham's criminals.

Rick: Well, crap, Morty. I guess we'll just have to find another hero to hang out with.

Morty: Yeah, maybe someone less brooding and more fun.

Rick: Like Deadpool, Morty! That guy knows how to have a good time.

Morty: I don't know, Rick. Deadpool seems a bit... unstable.

Rick: Unstable? That's what makes him interesting, Morty. Let's find a way to contact him.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Do we have any interdimensional communication devices, Rick?

Rick: Of course we do, Morty! Just give me a second.

[Rick walks to Workbench]

Rick: Here it is, Morty. The Interdimensional Communicator 3000.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Wow, Rick! That looks complicated.

Rick: It's not that complicated, Morty. Just press this button and say "Hey, Deadpool!"

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Okay, here goes nothing. Hey, Deadpool!

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]

Deadpool: Well, well, well. If it isn't my favorite interdimensional duo!

[Rick walks to Deadpool]

Rick: Deadpool, my man! We were just talking about you.

[Morty walks to Deadpool]

Morty: Yeah, we thought you'd be up for some crazy adventures with us.

Deadpool: Adventure? Count me in! But first, let's make a quick stop at the taco truck.

[Rick walks to Center Stage]

Rick: Taco truck? I'm in, Deadpool! Let's go on the wildest taco-fueled adventure ever!

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I knew this was gonna get weird.

Deadpool: Weird? That's my middle name, Morty! Let's go!

[Rick, Morty, and Deadpool enter the portal to BikiniBottom]
