Narrator: everyone must speak in extremely long poetic verses
Narrator: Prompt By: Dioptre
Rick: Morty, my dear boy, the cosmos calls us to the fray,
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Oh Rick, the stars' beckoning gives me dismay.
Rick: Fear not, young Morty, for in the face of the unknown,
We'll conquer galaxies, dimensions yet unshown.

[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: But Rick, the perils we face, the dangers we endure,
Are they worth it? Is the thrill of adventure so pure?
Rick: Morty, my lad, the thrill isn't in the danger or the fight,
It's in the discovery, in the marvel of the infinite night.

[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: See here, Morty, this device of quantum design,
With it, we'll traverse dimensions, through space and time.
Morty: Oh crap, Rick, that sounds like a risky feat,
Are you sure it's safe? Will our journey be replete?

[Rick walks to Center Stage]
Rick: Morty, my boy, life is a risk, a roll of the dice,
But with this device, we'll make our own paradise.
Morty: Uh, uh, Rick, if you think it's right,
Then I guess we'll embark on this interdimensional flight.

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Ah, the yard, a place of familiar ground,
Yet with this device, new mysteries can be found.
Jerry: Rick, Morty, what brings you out here?
[Rick walks to Morty]
Rick: Jerry, we're off to explore, to face the unknown without fear.

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, this place seems quite odd,
Homer: Welcome, strangers, to the abode of the Simpsons' squad.
Rick: Homer, my friend, we're here just to explore,
To seek out new dimensions, to open every door.

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Shrek: What're you doing in my swamp, you two?
Rick: Shrek, we're just passing through.
Morty: This place is, uh, uh, quite unique,
Shrek: Well, it's home to us, so don't critique.

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Morty, you see, the universe is vast and wide,
And with this device, we've got the best ride.
Morty: I guess, Rick, I'm starting to see,
That there's more to existence than just you and me.

Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty, that's the spirit,
In the face of the infinite, we've nothing to fear, it.
Morty: I'm ready, Rick, to face the unknown,
For in this grand cosmos, we're never alone.
