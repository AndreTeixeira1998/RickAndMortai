Narrator: Prompt By: Nin Playz RBX
Rick: Morty, I need you to hand me that quantum wrench over there.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: This one, Rick? 
Rick: Yes, that's the one. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Here you go, Rick. What are you working on this time?
Rick: Morty, I'm trying to fix this interdimensional portal gun. It's been acting up recently, and we don't want to end up in the wrong dimension. 
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, that sounds serious.
Rick: It is, Morty. It is. 
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: Alright, let's see if this works now. 
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Rick: Frick! This isn't where we were supposed to go! 
Shrek: What are you doing in my swamp?
Morty: Aww shoot, Rick. It's Shrek! 
Rick: I'm aware, Morty. 
Donkey: Hey, aren't you guys from that TV show? 
Morty: Uh, yeah, we are. 
Rick: Morty, hand me the portal gun. I need to fix it. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Rick: Thanks, Morty. Now let's get out of here. 
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Crap, Morty. That was a close one. 
Morty: Yeah, Rick. I didn't want to end up as an ogre's dinner. 
Rick: Well, Morty. That's the risk we take when we travel through dimensions. 
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I think I'd prefer to stay in our dimension for a while. 
Rick: Suit yourself, Morty. But remember, the multiverse is full of infinite possibilities. 
Morty: Yeah, yeah, I get it Rick. Wubba lubba dub dub, right?
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Now let's get back to work.
