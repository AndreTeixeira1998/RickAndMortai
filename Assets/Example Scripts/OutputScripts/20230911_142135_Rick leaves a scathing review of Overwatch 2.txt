Narrator: Rick leaves a scathing review of Overwatch 2
Narrator: Prompt By: Cancer In Advance
Rick: Morty, get over here! I need you to proofread this scathing review I've written for Overwatch 2.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Another review? Can't you just let people enjoy things?
Rick: Morty, when something is as disappointing as Overwatch 2, it's my duty to let the world know. Now, listen up. "Overwatch 2: A Crapshoot of Disappointment."
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, Rick, that seems a little harsh. Can't you tone it down a bit?
Rick: Morty, you can't sugarcoat the truth. Overwatch 2 had so much potential, but it shot itself in the foot. The developers should be ashamed of themselves.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: But Rick, millions of people love that game. Maybe you're just being too critical.
Rick: Shoot, Morty! I've played enough video games to know when something is a steaming pile of frick. Overwatch 2 promised innovation, but all it delivered was recycled content and a lackluster story mode.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: I get it, Rick. You're disappointed. But isn't there anything positive you can say about it?
Rick: Positive? Fine, I'll give you one positive. The graphics are pretty decent. But that's like putting lipstick on a crap-covered pig, Morty.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Okay, okay. I see your point, Rick. But isn't there a chance that the developers will improve the game in future updates?
Rick: Morty, Overwatch 2 had its chance. It had years of development and all it managed to do was let its fanbase down. I wouldn't hold my breath for any miraculous improvements.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. It's just a shame that something so hyped up turned out to be a disappointment.
Rick: Welcome to the world of gaming, Morty. Sometimes the hype train derails and crashes into a dumpster fire. It's just the nature of the industry.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Well, I guess I'll never understand your hatred for video games, Rick.
Rick: Morty, it's not about hatred. It's about holding developers accountable for their promises. If we settle for mediocrity, we'll never see true innovation.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I suppose you have a point, Rick. But can't we just enjoy things without overanalyzing them?
Rick: Morty, overanalyzing is what I do best. It's how we separate the gems from the garbage. And Overwatch 2, my friend, is pure garbage.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Alright, Rick. If you say so. But can we at least play something else now? My head hurts from all this negativity.
Rick: Sure, Morty. Let's fire up a game that won't make us want to jump off a bridge. How about we play "Blitz and Chitz: The Virtual Reality Experience"?
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. You know I always lose at that game.
Rick: Well, Morty, losing at Blitz and Chitz is still better than wasting time on Overwatch 2. Let's go, Morty. Adventure awaits us in the virtual world!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Alright, Rick. Let's escape this disappointing reality and dive into some mindless fun.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Wubba lubba dub dub! Let the gaming commence!
