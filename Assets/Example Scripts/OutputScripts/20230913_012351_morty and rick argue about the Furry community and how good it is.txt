Narrator: morty and rick argue about the Furry community and how good it is
Narrator: Prompt By: ZirrowtheFox
Rick: Morty, I need your opinion on something.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, sure Rick. What is it?
Rick: What do you think about the furry community, Morty?
Morty: The furry community? Uh, I don't know Rick. I mean, people should be allowed to like what they like, right?
Rick: That's a pretty diplomatic answer there, Morty. But what do you really think?
Morty: Well, uh, I guess it's a bit weird, Rick. But I mean, uh, who am I to judge?
Rick: So you're saying you don't have a problem with people dressing up as anthropomorphic animals and having conventions about it?
Morty: I mean, when you put it like that, it does sound a bit strange, Rick. But again, uh, who am I to judge?
Rick: That's pretty open-minded of you, Morty. But I have to tell you, I think it's a bunch of crap.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. You can't just say that. People have the right to like what they like.
Rick: Sure, Morty. But that doesn't mean I can't have an opinion about it. And my opinion is that it's fricking weird.
Morty: Well, Rick, maybe you're the weird one. Have you ever thought about that?
Rick: Me, weird? Morty, I'm a genius. I don't have time to be weird.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I don't think being a genius and being weird are mutually exclusive.
Rick: What the heck does that mean, Morty?
Morty: It means that you can be a genius and still be weird, Rick. Maybe even more so.
Rick: Well, shoot Morty. I didn't expect such deep insights from you.
Morty: Uh, thanks Rick. I guess.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Can we just drop this topic now?
Rick: Fine, Morty. But remember, just because people have the right to like something, doesn't mean I can't think it's crap.
Morty: Yeah, Rick. I got it.
