Narrator: Rick gives his opinion on Andrew tate and morty disagrees
Narrator: Prompt By: Kallum Ennis
Rick: Morty, let's talk about something different today.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, sure Rick. What do you want to talk about?
Rick: I've been watching this guy on the internet, Andrew Tate. He's a kickboxing world champion and he's pretty fricking cool.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Andrew Tate? The guy who says that depression isn't real and all that crap?
Rick: Yeah, that's the one. I mean, the guy's got some real guts, Morty. He just says what he thinks, no matter what. It's refreshing.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, I don't know, Rick. Some of the stuff he says is pretty controversial. I mean, it's not like he's a doctor or anything.
Rick: That's the point, Morty. He's not a doctor, he's a fighter. He's been through a lot and come out on top. It's something to admire.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: But Rick, just because he's a champion doesn't mean he's right about everything. I mean, look at Kanye West.
Rick: Ha! Kanye West. That guy's a genius, Morty. You just don't get it.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. You're just as bad as Tate. 
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! I'll take that as a compliment.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Well, it wasn't meant as one, Rick. I just think we should be careful about who we admire, you know?
Rick: Morty, you're missing the point. It's not about agreeing with everything someone says. It's about respecting their right to say it.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: I get that, Rick. But I still think Andrew Tate is a jerk.
Rick: Well, Morty, that's your opinion. And that's the beauty of it. We can disagree and still be friends.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. But I still think you're wrong about Andrew Tate.
Rick: And I still think you're wrong about Kanye West, Morty. But hey, that's life.
