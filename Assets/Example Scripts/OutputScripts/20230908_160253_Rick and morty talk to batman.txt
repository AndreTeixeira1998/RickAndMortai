Rick: Morty, I need you to grab that Bat Signal from the workbench.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. You're not saying we're going to...
Rick: That's right, Morty. We're summoning Batman.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: But Rick, isn't Batman just a fictional character?
Rick: Fictional in OUR universe, Morty. But in another universe, Batman is as real as you and me. 
Morty: Holy crap, Rick. This is insane!
Rick: Insane? Morty, we've done way crazier things than this. Now help me set up the Bat Signal.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Alright, Morty. Let's light this baby up.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Rick: Batman, we summon thee!
[Narrator: Suddenly, a portal appears and Batman steps out.]
Batman: Who dares summon the Dark Knight?
Rick: That would be us, Batman. I'm Rick, and this is Morty.
Morty: Hi, Batman. Big fan.
Batman: What do you want?
Rick: Just a quick chat, Batman. We're from another universe and we've got a few questions.
Batman: I'm listening.
Morty: First off, how do you keep your suit so clean? I mean, you're always fighting dirty criminals and yet your suit is always spotless.
Batman: Dry cleaning, kid. Lots and lots of dry cleaning.
Rick: Alright, Batman. Now for the real question - who would win in a fight, you or Superman?
Batman: That's a loaded question, Rick. We're both powerful in our own ways.
Morty: But if you had to pick?
Batman: I'd have to say...me. I'm Batman.
Rick: Ha! I knew it. Alright, Batman, thanks for your time. You can go back to your universe now.
Batman: Remember, the night is darkest just before the dawn.
Rick: Yeah, yeah. Wubba lubba dub dub.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Morty: Shoot, Rick. That was intense. We just met Batman!
Rick: Yep, Morty. Just another day in the multiverse.
Morty: I can't wait to tell my friends at school about this.
Rick: Morty, you can't tell anyone about this. You know the rule - what happens in the multiverse, stays in the multiverse.
Morty: Aww frick, Rick. You're right. Well, at least I'll always have the memories.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty. Now, let's get back to work. We've got more universes to explore!
