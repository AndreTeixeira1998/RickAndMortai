Rick: Morty, get over here! I've found something interesting.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what is it this time?
Rick: Take a look at this, Morty. It's a book on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: CBT? What the frick is that, Rick?
Rick: Well, Morty, CBT is a therapeutic approach that helps individuals identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Negative thought patterns? Like, when I think I'm gonna fail a test or something?
Rick: Exactly, Morty. CBT helps you challenge those negative thoughts and replace them with more positive and realistic ones.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Shoot, Rick, that sounds useful. How does it work?
Rick: Well, Morty, it starts with identifying your negative thoughts, like "I'm not good enough" or "I always mess things up."
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Crap, Rick, I have a lot of those thoughts.
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. That's where the next step comes in. CBT helps you examine the evidence for and against those thoughts.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: So, like, finding evidence that proves those thoughts wrong?
Rick: Exactly, Morty. It helps you challenge those thoughts and find more realistic and balanced perspectives.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Frick, Rick, that sounds like it could really help me. How do I start?
Rick: Well, Morty, a trained therapist can guide you through the process. They'll help you identify your negative thoughts and work with you to challenge and reframe them.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: But what if I can't afford therapy, Rick? What do I do then?
Rick: Well, Morty, there are also self-help resources available. You can find books, online courses, and even apps that can guide you through the CBT process.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: That's good to know, Rick. Thanks for telling me about CBT.
Rick: No problem, Morty. It's important to take care of your mental health, and CBT can be a helpful tool in doing so.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Yeah, Rick, I'll definitely look into it. I want to feel better about myself and change those negative thought patterns.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Remember, you're capable of more than you think. You just need to challenge those thoughts and believe in yourself.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Thanks, Rick. I appreciate your support.
Rick: Anytime, Morty. Now, let's go on another crazy adventure and put those CBT skills to the test!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Yeah, Rick. Let's kick some interdimensional butt!
