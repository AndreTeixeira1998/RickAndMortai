Narrator: Rick and morty talk to batman
Narrator: Prompt By: me
Rick: Morty, get your frickin' butt over here! I've got something important to show you.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what is it this time? Can't I just have a moment of peace?
Rick: Peace? Morty, peace is overrated. We've got a visitor, and it's none other than Batman!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Batman? Like, THE Batman? The Dark Knight himself?
Rick: That's right, Morty. He's here to ask for our help. Apparently, the Joker has stolen his Batmobile, and he needs our genius minds to track it down.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Whoa, Rick, this is huge! We're gonna team up with Batman? This is gonna be epic!
Rick: Yeah, yeah, Morty, keep your excitement under control. We're not here to play superheroes. We're here to solve a problem. Now, where's Batman?
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: He's right here, Rick. Batman, meet my grandpa, Rick. Rick, meet Batman.
Batman: Greetings, Rick. I've heard great things about your intellect. I hope you can assist me in retrieving my Batmobile.
Rick: Pleasure to meet you, Batman. I'm always up for a challenge. So, what's the plan?
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Yeah, Batman, tell us what we need to do. We're ready to kick some Joker butt!
Batman: The Joker has left a trail of clues throughout Gotham City, leading to the location of the Batmobile. We need to follow the clues and find it before he causes any more chaos.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Sounds like a plan, Batman! Let's get to work. We'll use our portal gun to teleport to Gotham City and start the search.
Rick: Morty, get the portal gun ready. We're going on a frickin' adventure with Batman!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Gotham City]
Rick: Alright, Batman, lead the way. We're ready to solve this mystery.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Yeah, Batman, show us your detective skills. We're here to help!
Batman: Thank you, Rick and Morty. Together, we can bring justice to Gotham City and put an end to the Joker's madness.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well, that was a wild ride, Morty. We helped Batman recover his Batmobile and saved the day.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, that was intense! I can't believe we actually teamed up with Batman!
Rick: Yeah, Morty, sometimes life takes you on unexpected adventures. But hey, we're back in the garage now, safe and sound.
Morty: Yeah, I guess you're right, Rick. It was worth it. Wubba lubba dub dub!
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty. Now, let's clean up the garage and get back to our usual interdimensional shenanigans.
Morty: Sure thing, Rick. But can we take a break first? I need to process everything that just happened.
Rick: Of course, Morty. Take all the time you need. But remember, adventure never stops!
