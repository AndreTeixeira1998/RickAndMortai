Narrator: Homer argues that a first past the post voting system is bad for democracy, and we should switch to alternate voting systems
Narrator: Prompt By: Joe Sean A G
Rick: Morty, we need to talk.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, what's up, Rick?
Rick: We're going to the Simpsons' house, Morty. I need to settle a debate with Homer.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: A debate? With Homer? Aww jeez, Rick, what about?
Rick: About democracy, Morty. About the fricking voting system.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, okay, Rick. I guess we can do that.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Homer: Hey, Rick! You're just in time for our discussion.
[Rick walks to Homer]
Rick: That's why we're here, Homer. Let's get this crap started.
Homer: Okay, Rick. I believe that a first past the post voting system is terrible for democracy.
Rick: And why is that, Homer?
Homer: Because it discourages smaller parties and independent candidates from running, Rick! It's all about the big guys with this system.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, that sounds kinda unfair, Homer.
Homer: Exactly, Morty! That's why we need alternate voting systems.
[Rick walks to Morty]
Rick: Morty, don't just agree with him. Question it.
[Morty walks to Homer]
Morty: Uh, okay. What kind of alternate systems are you thinking, Homer?
Homer: Well, Morty, there's proportional representation, single transferable vote, or ranked-choice voting.
[Rick walks to Homer]
Rick: And how exactly would they improve democracy, Homer?
Homer: They would give smaller parties a chance, Rick! They would represent the people's choice better!
[Rick walks to Center Stage]
Rick: Well, shoot, Homer. I can't argue with that.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: So, uh, we're just gonna change the entire voting system?
Rick: Maybe, Morty. Maybe. It's a complex issue, but it's worth considering.
Homer: That's all I wanted, Rick. For people to consider it.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! That was a real brain buster.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I just wanted to watch some TV.
Rick: And yet here we are, Morty, discussing the intricacies of democracy.
Morty: Yeah, Rick. It's pretty wild.
Rick: That's the multiverse for you, Morty. Always full of surprises.
