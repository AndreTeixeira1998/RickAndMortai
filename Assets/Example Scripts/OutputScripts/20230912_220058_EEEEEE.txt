Narrator: Prompt By: Josstri
Rick: Morty, get your frickin' butt in here!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez Rick, what's the emergency this time?
Rick: Emergency? No, Morty, I just found something interesting. Look at this device I created.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Uh, what does it do, Rick?
Rick: It's a portal gun, Morty. With this, we can travel to different dimensions and have all sorts of wacky adventures!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Whoa, that sounds cool, Rick. But is it safe?
Rick: Safe? Morty, I've used this thing countless times. The worst that can happen is we end up in a dimension with a bunch of weird aliens or something.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Alright, Rick. Let's give it a shot. But if anything goes wrong, I'm blaming you.
Rick: Frick yeah, Morty! That's the spirit! Let's go on an interdimensional joyride!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Jerry: Hey, guys! What are you up to?
[Rick walks to Jerry]
Rick: None of your business, Jerry. We're going on an adventure. You stay here and take care of the yard or something.
[Jerry walks to Center Stage]
Jerry: But Rick, I wanna come too! I'm tired of being stuck in this boring yard all the time.
Rick: Tough crap, Jerry. You're not coming with us. You'd just slow us down.
[Morty walks to Jerry]
Morty: Sorry, Dad. Maybe next time.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Alright, Morty, let's see where this portal takes us. Brace yourself for some mind-blowing sci-fi shenanigans!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I'm ready, Rick. Let's see what crazy adventures await us in the multiverse!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Simpsons House]
Homer: D'oh! Who are you guys and what are you doing in my living room?
[Rick walks to Homer]
Rick: Relax, Homer. We're just passing through. We'll be out of your hair in no time.
[Morty walks to Marge]
Morty: Hi, Marge. Sorry for the intrusion. We'll be gone soon.
Marge: Oh, it's quite alright. Just be careful not to make a mess, please.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Shreks Swamp]
Shrek: What are you doing in my swamp?
[Rick walks to Shrek]
Rick: We're just exploring, Shrek. No need to get all ogre-protective.
[Morty walks to Donkey]
Morty: Hey, Donkey. Nice to meet you. We'll be on our way soon.
Donkey: Alright, but if you need any help, just holler. I'm a great sidekick, you know!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Star Wars Cantina]
Yoda: Welcome, you are, to the Star Wars Cantina.
[Rick walks to Yoda]
Rick: Thanks, Yoda. We're just passing through, but we'll enjoy a quick drink before we go.
[Morty walks to Jar Jar Binks]
Morty: Hey, Jar Jar. Nice to meet you. We're in a hurry, but maybe we can hang out another time.
Jar Jar Binks: Oh, meesa understand. Maybe next time, weesa can go on an adventure together!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Back Alley]
Narrator: In the shadowy back alley, Rick and Morty find themselves surrounded by mysterious figures.
Rick: Frick, Morty. Looks like we stumbled into a dodgy situation here.
Morty: Uh, Rick, I think we should portal out of here. This doesn't feel safe.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal back to the Garage]
Rick: Phew, that was close. We need to be more careful with the portals, Morty.
Morty: Yeah, Rick. I don't think I can handle any more crazy adventures today.
Rick: Aw, come on, Morty. Where's your sense of adventure?
Morty: It's buried under a whole lot of "uh uh" and "re re really" right now, Rick.
Rick: Well, maybe we'll take a break for now. But remember, Morty, the universe is our playground. Wubba lubba dub dub!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Can't we just have a normal day for once?
Rick: Normal? Morty, normal is overrated. Let's embrace the chaos and keep exploring the infinite possibilities of the multiverse!
Morty: Alright, Rick. But just promise me one thing.
Rick: What's that, Morty?
Morty: No more back alleys, okay? Those guys were creepy.
Rick: Deal, Morty. No more dodgy back alleys. Now, let's go watch some interdimensional TV!
