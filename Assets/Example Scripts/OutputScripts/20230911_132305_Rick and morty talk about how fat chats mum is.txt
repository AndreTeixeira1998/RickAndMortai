Narrator: Rick and morty talk about how fat chats mum is
Narrator: Prompt By: me
Rick: Morty, have you noticed how fat your mom has gotten?

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Uh, Rick, that's not cool. You shouldn't talk about Mom like that.

Rick: Oh, come on, Morty. I'm just stating the obvious. She's put on a few pounds.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Well, maybe she's just been stressed out lately. You know, dealing with all our crazy adventures.

Rick: Yeah, yeah, stress. That's a good excuse. But let's be real, Morty. She's been stress eating like there's no tomorrow.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Rick, she's your daughter-in-law. Show some respect.

Rick: Respect? Morty, I respect her enough to tell her the truth. She needs to lay off the junk food.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Rick, you can't just criticize her like that. It's not fair.

Rick: Life isn't fair, Morty. And neither is this conversation. But sometimes, we have to face the frickin' truth.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Shoot, Rick. You're being really insensitive. Mom's been through a lot lately.

Rick: Oh, crap, Morty. Are you defending her? Are you taking her side?

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: I'm not taking sides, Rick. I'm just saying we should be more understanding.

Rick: Understanding? Morty, I understand perfectly fine. She's let herself go, plain and simple.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: You know what, Rick? I'm done with this conversation. It's not worth it.

Rick: Fine, Morty. Run away from the truth. But remember, I'm always right.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Maybe you're right, Rick. But sometimes being right doesn't mean you have to be a jerk about it.

Rick: Jerk? Morty, I'm a genius. I don't have time for sensitivity.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Well, maybe you should make time, Rick. Maybe you should try being a little more compassionate.

Rick: Compassionate? Morty, I'm a scientist. I deal with facts, not feelings.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Rick, feelings matter too. And right now, you're hurting Mom's feelings.

Rick: Crap, Morty. I didn't mean to hurt her feelings. I just wanted her to take care of herself.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Well, maybe there's a better way to express your concerns. Maybe you should talk to her, not criticize her.

Rick: Talk? Morty, talking is for weaklings. I'll stick with my methods, thank you very much.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Well, Rick, maybe it's time to reconsider your methods. Maybe it's time to be a better person.

Rick: Better person? Morty, I'm the best person there is. I'm Rick Sanchez, the smartest man in the universe.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Being smart doesn't make you a good person, Rick. It's how you treat others that matters.

Rick: Well, Morty, maybe you're right. Maybe I need to work on my people skills.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: I'm glad you see it that way, Rick. We can all learn and grow, even you.

Rick: Yeah, yeah, growth and all that crap. But don't expect me to change overnight.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: I don't expect miracles, Rick. Just a little bit of empathy.

Rick: Empathy? Morty, that's a frickin' tall order. But I'll try, for your sake.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Thanks, Rick. It means a lot to me.

Rick: Yeah, yeah, don't get sentimental on me. Let's get back to our adventures, Morty.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Sounds good, Rick. But let's try to be a little more considerate of others along the way.

Rick: Fine, Morty. Consideration, empathy, all that crap. Just don't expect me to become a saint.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: I don't expect you to be a saint, Rick. Just a better version of yourself.

Rick: Well, Morty, we'll see about that. Let's get back to work.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Alright, Rick. But remember, change starts with small steps.

Rick: Small steps, Morty. I'll keep that in mind. Now, let's go on another mind-bending adventure!
