Rick: Morty, we've got a new adventure lined up.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what is it this time?
Rick: We're going to a dimension you've never seen before, Morty. 
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Alright, Rick. Where are we headed?
Rick: We're heading to Shrek's Swamp, Morty. 
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Shrek: Oi, who are you two doing in my swamp?
Rick: We're just passing by, Shrek. My grandson here is a big fan.
Morty: Uh, yeah, big fan. 
[Shrek walks to Morty]
Shrek: Well, it's not everyday I get fans in my swamp. What brings you here?
Morty: We're just exploring, Shrek.
Donkey: Hey Shrek, who are these folks?
Shrek: They're fans, Donkey. Fans. 
[Donkey walks to Rick]
Donkey: Fans, huh? Well, welcome to the swamp. 
Rick: Thanks, Donkey. 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: This place is kinda cool, Rick. 
Rick: Told you Morty. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Shrek walks to Rick]
Shrek: What's that you said?
Rick: It's just a catchphrase, Shrek. 
Morty: Yeah, it doesn't really mean anything. 
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Morty: That was fun, Rick. Shrek's swamp is pretty cool. 
Rick: Yeah, Morty. It's a whole different world out there. 
Morty: Can we go back sometime, Rick?
Rick: Sure thing, Morty. But remember, there's a whole multiverse out there to explore. Wubba lubba dub dub!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I guess you're right. Let's see what's next.
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty. Now, let's see what other dimensions we can visit.
