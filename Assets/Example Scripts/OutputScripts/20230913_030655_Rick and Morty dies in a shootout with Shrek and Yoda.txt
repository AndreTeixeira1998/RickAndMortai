Narrator: Rick and Morty dies in a shootout with Shrek and Yoda
Narrator: Prompt By: Rei the Goat
Rick: Morty, I've got a crazy idea. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, Rick, what kind of crazy are we talking about?
Rick: We're going to have a shootout with Shrek and Yoda! 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Are you frickin' kidding me, Rick? Those guys are legends! 
Rick: Exactly, Morty. It's time we prove ourselves as the real legends. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I don't think this is a good idea.
Rick: Morty, when have my ideas ever been bad? 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, re re really Rick? Do you really want me to answer that?
Rick: Shut up, Morty. Let's go and kick some butt! 
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Shrek: What are you doing in my swamp?
Donkey: Yeah, you better leave before Shrek gets mad.
Rick: We're here for a shootout, Shrek. You and Yoda.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. What have you gotten us into?
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Starwars Cantina]
Yoda: Hmm, a shootout, you seek? Ready, I am. 
Jar Jar Binks: Mesa no want any trouble! 
Rick: Too late for that, Jar Jar. Let's do this! 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Rick, I'm really not comfortable with this. 
Rick: Morty, just shoot and don't think too much. 
[Narrator: A chaotic shootout ensues. Blasters and lasers fly everywhere. Shrek charges at Rick, while Yoda uses the Force to deflect the shots.]
Morty: Aww crap, Rick! We're in over our heads!
Rick: Morty, just keep shooting! 
[Narrator: Eventually, Rick and Morty run out of ammunition. Shrek and Yoda stand victorious.]
Rick: Well, shit. We're screwed, Morty.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I told you this was a bad idea!
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! We're going out with a bang!
[Narrator: Rick and Morty charge at Shrek and Yoda one last time, but they are ultimately defeated.]
Rick: Well, Morty. It was a good run. 
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. We're really dying, aren't we?
Rick: Yes, Morty. But at least we went out like legends.
