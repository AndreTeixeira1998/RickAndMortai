Narrator: rick and morty swap bodies
Narrator: Prompt By: Lako Unbekannt
Rick: Morty, I've been working on a new invention. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Oh, uh, re-really Rick? What is it this time?
Rick: It's a mind switcher, Morty. We can swap bodies!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Swap bodies? Aww jeez, Rick, that sounds like a frickin' nightmare.
Rick: Don't be such a wuss, Morty. It's for science!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: I don't know, Rick. It sounds dangerous.
Rick: Don't be such a drama queen, Morty. It's perfectly safe.
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: Alright, Morty. Prepare to have your mind blown!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Jeez, it's cold out here. Why'd we have to come outside for this, Rick?
Morty: I don't know, Rick. I just do what you tell me to do.
Rick: Well, let's get this over with.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Alright, Morty. It's time to switch bodies.
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: Okay, Morty. On the count of three, we press these buttons and switch bodies.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Okay, Rick. I'm ready.
Narrator: Rick and Morty press the buttons and their minds swap bodies.
Rick: Holy crap, Morty! I'm in your body!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: And I'm in yours, Rick! This is so weird.
Rick: Okay, Morty. Let's see how this goes.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Rick: Aww jeez, Morty. I forgot how much you stutter.
Morty: And I forgot how much you burp, Rick. It's disgusting.
Homer: Who are you guys?
Rick: We're Rick and Morty, Homer. We just switched bodies.
Marge: Oh my, that sounds like quite an adventure.
Bart: Can I try it?
Rick: No, Bart. This is for science, not for fun.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I don't think I can handle being you much longer.
Rick: You're right, Morty. This was a horrible idea.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Let's switch back, Morty.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Yeah, let's do that, Rick.
Narrator: Rick and Morty press the buttons again and switch back to their original bodies.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! That was a wild ride!
Morty: Yeah, Rick. Let's never do that again.
