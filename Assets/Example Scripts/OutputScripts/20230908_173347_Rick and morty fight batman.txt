Narrator: Prompt By me
Rick: Morty, get your butt over here! I've got a new invention.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, not another invention. What is it this time?
Rick: I've created a device that can summon any character from any dimension, Morty.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Any character? Like, even Batman?
Rick: Exactly, Morty! Even Batman!
Morty: But why would we want to summon Batman, Rick? He's a superhero. He'll kick our butts!
Rick: Not if we're prepared, Morty. Not if we're prepared.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Alright Morty, now to summon Batman.
[Batman appears]
Batman: Who dares summon the Dark Knight?
Rick: It's us, Batman. Rick and Morty.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Batman looks pissed.
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. I've got a plan.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Alright, Morty. Here's the plan. We're gonna fight Batman.
Morty: Fight Batman? Are you fricking kidding me, Rick?
Rick: No, Morty. I'm not kidding. We're gonna fight Batman and we're gonna win.
Morty: How the heck are we supposed to beat Batman, Rick?
Rick: With science, Morty. With science.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Okay, Rick. I trust you. Let's do this.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Batman: You've returned. Are you ready to face your doom?
Rick: Bring it on, Batman. We're ready for you.
[Batman attacks, but Rick and Morty dodge]
Morty: Aww shoot, Rick! Batman's really strong!
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. We've got this.
[Rick and Morty attack Batman and manage to overpower him]
Rick: Ha! Take that, Batman! Science beats brute strength any day!
Morty: Wow, Rick. We actually did it. We beat Batman.
Rick: That's right, Morty. We did. And it's all thanks to science.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I think I need to lie down.
Rick: Good idea, Morty. Let's head back to the garage.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well, Morty, I think we've had enough excitement for one day.
Morty: Yeah, you're right, Rick. I'm beat. Let's call it a day.
Rick: Good plan, Morty. Good plan.
