Rick: Morty, look at this contraption I've built.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, Rick, what is it?
Rick: It's a dimension hopping device, Morty. Think of the adventures we could have!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, uh, are you sure it's safe, Rick?
Rick: Morty, when have I ever put you in danger?
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, constantly, Rick. You're always putting me in danger.
Rick: Well, Morty, I guess that's a matter of perspective.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Shrek: Oi, who are you two doing in my swamp?
Rick: We're just passing through, Shrek. Don't mind us.
Shrek: Well, make sure you don't touch anything.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, Rick, why did we come here?
Rick: I wanted to see if this place was as crappy as it looks in the movies. It is.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Homer: D'oh, who are you guys?
Rick: We're just passing through, Homer. Don't worry about it.
Marge: Boys, don't bother the guests.
Bart: Eat my shorts, man.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well, Morty, what did you think of our little adventure?
Morty: Uh, Rick, it was really weird. I don't think I want to do that again.
Rick: Aw, Morty, you're such a buzzkill. Wubba lubba dub dub!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Can we just go watch some TV now?
Rick: Fine, Morty. Let's go watch some interdimensional cable.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Thanks, Rick. I just need a break from all this sci-fi stuff.
Rick: You're welcome, Morty. Just remember, adventure is out there. Waiting for us.
Morty: Yeah, Rick. I'll remember that.
