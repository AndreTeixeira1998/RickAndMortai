Narrator: homer has horrible Vietnam flashbacks while rick and morty continually say eeeeeeeeeeeee over and over again
Narrator: Prompt By: JustinTime007
Rick: Morty, I've got an idea. We're going on a trip.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez Rick, where are we going this time?
Rick: We're going to the Simpson's house. I've got a theory about Homer.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, what kind of theory, Rick?
Rick: I think he's been having Vietnam flashbacks, Morty. We need to investigate.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Wait, what? Rick, are you sure about this? It sounds like a really bad idea.
Rick: Trust me, Morty. It will be fine.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Rick: Alright, there's Homer. Now, start saying "eeeeeeeeeee" over and over again.
Morty: Uh, Rick, are you sure this is a good idea?
Rick: Just do it, Morty.
Morty: Eeeeeeeeeeee...
Rick: Eeeeeeeeeeee...
Homer: What the... Who are you guys?
Rick: We're just a couple of interdimensional travelers, Homer. Don't mind us.
Homer: What's with all the "eeeeeeeeeee"?
Rick: We're testing a theory. Do you feel anything unusual?
Homer: Unusual? Well, now that you mention it...
Morty: Aww, frick, Rick. I think it's working.
Rick: Keep going, Morty.
Morty: Eeeeeeeeeeee...
Homer: I'm starting to remember... The war...
Rick: That's it, Homer. Let it all out.
Homer: It was terrible... So terrible...
Morty: Aww, crap, Rick. I think we've gone too far.
Rick: It's okay, Morty. We're here to help Homer, not hurt him.
Homer: The flashbacks... They're so vivid...
Rick: It's okay, Homer. It's okay.
Morty: Aww, shoot, Rick. I can't do this anymore.
Rick: Fine, Morty. We'll stop for now.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well, Morty, I think we've made some progress today.
Morty: Progress? Rick, we just made a man relive his horrific past.
Rick: Yes, but now he can start healing, Morty. That's progress.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I hope you're right.
Rick: I'm always right, Morty. Wubba lubba dub dub!
