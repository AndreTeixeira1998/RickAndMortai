Narrator: Rick and morty fight batman
Narrator: Prompt By: me
Rick: Morty, get over here! I've got a new adventure for us.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. What is it this time?
Rick: We're going to have a showdown with Batman, Morty. The Caped Crusader himself.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Batman? Are you serious, Rick? He's a superhero! We're just a couple of regular guys.
Rick: Regular guys? Morty, we've taken on interdimensional beings, aliens, and even gods. Batman is no match for us.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: I don't know, Rick. He's got all those gadgets and the Batmobile. We don't stand a chance.
Rick: Gadgets and Batmobile? Morty, we've got a portal gun and a spaceship. We're in a whole different league.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Alright, Rick. If you say so. But what's the plan?
Rick: We're going to lure Batman into a trap. We'll set up a fake distress signal and when he arrives, we'll ambush him.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Ambush? That doesn't sound very heroic, Rick.
Rick: Heroic? Morty, we're not heroes. We're adventurers. We do what needs to be done to survive.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. So, how do we set up this fake distress signal?
Rick: Easy, Morty. We just need to hack into the Bat-signal and redirect it to our location.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Hack into the Bat-signal? Isn't that illegal, Rick?
Rick: Illegal? Morty, we're bending the rules of time and space on a daily basis. A little hacking is nothing.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Alright, Rick. Let's do it. But if Batman shows up and kicks our butts, I'm holding you responsible.
Rick: Fair enough, Morty. But trust me, we've got this. We're the smartest guys in any universe.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Alright, Morty. The fake distress signal is active. Now we wait for Batman to take the bait.
Morty: I hope this works, Rick. I don't want to end up in Arkham Asylum.
Rick: Relax, Morty. We've got a plan. Just stay focused.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Morty, look! It's Batman!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. He's here already?
Rick: Quick, Morty! Get ready for battle!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Batman's Lair]
Rick: Batman, prepare to meet your match!
Batman: Who are you two?
Morty: We're Rick and Morty, and we're here to take you down, Batman!
Batman: You think you can defeat me? I'm the Dark Knight!
Rick: Oh please, Batman. We've seen scarier things than you on our adventures.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Yeah, like that time we fought a giant alien worm with laser eyes.
Batman: Enough talk. Let's settle this.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. We didn't stand a chance against Batman.
Rick: Yeah, Morty. Turns out he's a lot tougher than we thought.
Morty: So, what now, Rick?
Rick: Now we regroup, Morty. We'll come up with a new plan and take him down next time.
Morty: Alright, Rick. But let's make sure we're better prepared next time.
Rick: Agreed, Morty. We'll show Batman that he's not the only one with tricks up his sleeve.
