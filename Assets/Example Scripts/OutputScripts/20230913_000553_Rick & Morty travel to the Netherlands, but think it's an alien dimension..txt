Narrator: Rick & Morty travel to the Netherlands, but think it's an alien dimension.
Narrator: Prompt By: Equinox
Rick: Morty, I've got a new dimension for us to explore. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Oh, uh, really Rick? What's it called?
Rick: I don't know Morty, I just picked a random dimension. Let's just go and see what's there.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Back Alley]
Rick: Frick Morty, this isn't another dimension, it's just a back alley. 
Morty: Shoot Rick, what now? 
Rick: Let's try this again.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Morty, we're in the Netherlands. 
Morty: The Netherlands? Isn't that on Earth, Rick?
Rick: No Morty, it's a strange alien dimension. Look at those weird structures, they call them windmills.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, Rick, I'm pretty sure this is just the Netherlands. Like, on Earth. 
Rick: No, Morty, it's a different dimension. These aliens just happen to look exactly like humans. And speak English. And Dutch. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, I don't know about this. 
Rick: Trust me Morty, this is an alien dimension. Now come on, let's explore. 
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Crap Morty, we're back in the garage. 
Morty: Rick, I think you messed up the portal gun.
Rick: No Morty, the portal gun is fine. It's just... it's just... uh...
Morty: It's just what, Rick?
Rick: It's just... Wubba lubba dub dub!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Can't we just stay in one place for once?
Rick: Morty, you're missing the point. The beauty of our adventures is the unpredictability, the chaos! Now come on, let's try again.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: See Morty, we're back in the Netherlands. I told you it was a different dimension.
Morty: Rick, this is still the yard. We're still on Earth. 
Rick: No Morty, it's the Netherlands. A different dimension. Now come on, let's go and try some of those alien pastries they call 'stroopwafels'. 
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. If you say so.
