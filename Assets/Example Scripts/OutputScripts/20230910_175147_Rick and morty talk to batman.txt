Narrator: Rick and morty talk to batman
Narrator: Prompt By: me
Rick: Morty, I've got a brilliant idea! Let's use the portal to visit Gotham City and meet Batman!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Batman? Seriously, Rick? Isn't he just a fictional character?
Rick: Morty, Batman may be fictional, but in the multiverse, anything is possible! Plus, I heard he's got some cool gadgets.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Alright, Rick, let's give it a shot. But remember, if Batman doesn't exist, I'm blaming you.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Gotham City]
Rick: Well, Morty, here we are in Gotham City. Let's find Batman!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Holy crap, Rick! Look over there! It's the Bat-Signal!
Rick: Frick, Morty! We hit the jackpot! Let's go check it out!
[Rick and Morty walk to the Bat-Signal]
Batman: I've been expecting you, Rick and Morty.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Batman! How did you know we were coming?
Batman: I'm Batman, Morty. I know everything. Now, what brings you to Gotham City?
[Rick walks to Center Stage]
Rick: Well, Batman, we're here to see if you're real or just a figment of Morty's imagination.
Batman: I assure you, I'm as real as it gets. But what do you want from me?
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: We just wanted to meet the legendary Dark Knight himself, Batman. We're big fans!
Batman: Well, I appreciate the admiration. But I have a city to protect. Can't waste time on fanboys.
[Rick walks to Center Stage]
Rick: Fanboys? Morty, we're not fanboys. We're interdimensional travelers seeking knowledge and adventure!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Yeah, Batman! We've been to countless dimensions and faced all sorts of crazy stuff. We're like heroes ourselves!
Batman: Heroes, huh? Well, if you're heroes, prove it. Help me catch the Joker. He's causing chaos in Gotham.
[Rick walks to Center Stage]
Rick: Catching the Joker? That sounds like a job for Rick and Morty! Let's go, Morty!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Arkham Asylum]
Rick: Alright, Morty, keep your eyes peeled. We're in Arkham Asylum, the Joker's playground.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. This place gives me the creeps. Let's find the Joker and get out of here.
[Rick and Morty walk to the Joker's cell]
Joker: Well, well, well, what do we have here? A couple of wannabe heroes?
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Shoot, it's the Joker! Rick, what do we do?
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. I've got a plan. Joker, we're here to put an end to your chaos!
Joker: Oh, how delightful! Two more victims for my twisted games!
[Rick and Morty enter a battle with the Joker]
Rick: Morty, use the portal gun to create a distraction!
Morty: Got it, Rick! *opens portal behind Joker*
[Joker falls into the portal]
Joker: Whoa, what the crap is happening?!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Well, Morty, we did it! We defeated the Joker and saved Gotham City!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. That was intense. But I'm glad we could help Batman.
Rick: Yeah, Morty, it was a wild adventure. But remember, in the multiverse, there's always more craziness waiting for us.
Morty: I know, Rick. But can we take a break from the chaos for a while?
Rick: Of course, Morty. We'll have some interdimensional TV time. But remember, adventure awaits us whenever we're ready.
Morty: Alright, Rick. Let's go enjoy some mindless entertainment for a change.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
