Narrator: Everyone just fucking screams. All the time.
Narrator: Prompt By: Jack Leando
Rick: Morty, I've got something for you to see.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez Rick, what is it now?
Rick: Take a look at this Morty, it's an interdimensional scream extractor.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Uh, Rick, why do we need a device to extract screams?
Rick: Morty, screams are a form of energy. With this device, we can harness that energy!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: But Rick, isn't that a bit... unethical?
Rick: Ethics, shmethics, Morty. This is about survival of the fittest!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I don't know, Rick. It just doesn't seem right.
Rick: Morty, sometimes you have to do what's necessary, not what's right.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I guess you're right.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Now, let's get to work.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Jerry: Hey, what are you guys up to?
Rick: None of your business, Jerry. Go back to watering the plants.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, we're just working on a little project, Dad.
Jerry: Well, just keep it down. You're scaring the neighbors.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Garage]
Rick: Frick, Jerry is such a buzzkill.
Morty: Yeah, he can be a bit much sometimes.
Rick: Well, Morty, let's get back to work. We've got screams to extract!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I hope this doesn't end up like last time.
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. We've got this under control. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, okay, Rick. If you say so.
Rick: Trust me, Morty. This is going to be great. Just you wait and see.
