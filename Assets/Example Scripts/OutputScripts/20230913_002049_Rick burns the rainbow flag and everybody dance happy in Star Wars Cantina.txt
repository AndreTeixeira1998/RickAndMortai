Narrator: Rick burns the rainbow flag and everybody dance happy in Star Wars Cantina
Narrator: Prompt By: RegolaD
Rick: Morty, I've got a plan.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, what kind of plan, Rick?
Rick: We're going to Star Wars Cantina, Morty. I've got something to do there.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Star Wars Cantina? Rick, I don't think that's a good idea. Last time we went there, you almost got us killed.
Rick: Relax, Morty. I've got everything under control.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Starwars Cantina]
Rick: Here we are, Morty. The Star Wars Cantina.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: So, uh, what's the plan, Rick?
Rick: See that rainbow flag over there, Morty? I'm going to burn it.
Morty: Burn it? Rick, that's not cool. That's someone's property.
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. They won't mind. In fact, they'll love it.
[Rick walks to Center Stage]
Rick: Watch this, Morty.
Narrator: Rick burns the rainbow flag.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I hope you know what you're doing.
Rick: Trust me, Morty. This is going to be fun.
Narrator: Everyone in the Cantina starts dancing.
Morty: Holy crap, Rick. They're actually enjoying it.
Rick: Told you, Morty. They love a good show.
Yoda: Dance, we will. Good show, this is.
Jar Jar Binks: Meesa agree! Burning flag, very fun!
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! This is the life!
Morty: Yeah, Rick. I guess this wasn't so bad after all.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well, Morty. That was a successful trip. What do you think?
Morty: I guess it was okay, Rick. But next time, can we do something less risky?
Rick: Risky? Morty, where's the fun in that?
