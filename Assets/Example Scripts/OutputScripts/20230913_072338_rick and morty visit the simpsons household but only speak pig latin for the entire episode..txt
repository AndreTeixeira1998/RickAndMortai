Narrator: rick and morty visit the simpsons household but only speak pig latin for the entire episode.
Narrator: Prompt By: TheMlgCat
Rick: Morty, I've got a fun idea for a little experiment.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, uh, okay, Rick. What's the plan?
Rick: We're going to visit The Simpsons, Morty. But we're going to speak only in Pig Latin. 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Pig Latin? Are you kidding me, Rick? That sounds like a fricking nightmare.
Rick: Oh, shoot, Morty. It's going to be hilarious. You'll see.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Homer: Hey, who are you guys?
Rick: Ick-ray. And this is my grandson, Orty-may.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, hi, Omer-hay. We're just visiting from another dimension.
Bart: Whoa, that's cool! What's with the weird talk?
Rick: It's Ig-pay Atin-lay, Art-bay. Don't you know anything?
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Rick, this is getting ridiculous. I feel like a complete idiot.
Rick: Oh, crap, Morty. Lighten up. It's just a bit of fun.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. It's not like we're hurting anyone.
Marge: You boys are certainly different. Would you like some cookies?
Rick: Eys-yay, Arge-may. We would ove-lay ome-say ookies-cay.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. We're going to get fat if we keep eating like this.
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. We'll burn off the calories when we run from the interdimensional police.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! That was quite the adventure!
Morty: I've had enough Pig Latin for one day, Rick. Can we just speak normally now?
Rick: Of course, Morty. But remember, life is more fun when you mix things up a bit.
Morty: Yeah, yeah. I get it, Rick. Can we just relax now?
Rick: Sure thing, Morty. We deserve a break after all that linguistic gymnastics.
