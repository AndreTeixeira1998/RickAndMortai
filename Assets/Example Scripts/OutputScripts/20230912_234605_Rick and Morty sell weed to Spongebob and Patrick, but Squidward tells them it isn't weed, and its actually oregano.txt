Narrator: Prompt By: Rickwhy
Rick: Morty, grab the bag from the workbench.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Uh, this bag, Rick? The one with the green leaves?
Rick: Yes, Morty, that's the one. We're going to make a quick buck.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Are we selling weed?
Rick: Not just any weed, Morty. It's interdimensional space weed.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Shrek: What are you doing in my swamp?
Rick: Chill, Shrek. We're just passing through.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Bart: Whoa, what's that smell?
Rick: It's the good stuff, Bart. We're selling.
Homer: D'oh! Marge, the kids are doing drugs again!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Back Alley]
Rick: Alright, Morty. We're here to make the deal.
Patrick: Is this the stuff, Rick?
Rick: You bet, Patrick. Best weed in all dimensions.
Morty: Aww, crap Rick. Are we really selling to Patrick and Spongebob?
Rick: Relax, Morty. It's just business.
Patrick: Here's the money, Rick.
Rick: Pleasure doing business with you, Patrick.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well, Morty, that went well.
Morty: I don't know, Rick. I feel kinda bad.
Rick: Why, Morty? We just made a quick buck.
Squidward: Wait a minute. This isn't weed. It's oregano!
Rick: Frick, Morty. I think we've been caught.
Morty: Aww, shoot Rick. What do we do?
Rick: We run, Morty. We run.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Shrek: You again? What are you running from now?
Rick: It's a long story, Shrek. But we're in a bit of a pickle.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I knew we shouldn't have sold that oregano.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty. It's all part of the adventure.
