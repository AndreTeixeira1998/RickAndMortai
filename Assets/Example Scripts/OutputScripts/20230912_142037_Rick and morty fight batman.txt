Narrator: Rick and morty fight batman
Narrator: Prompt By: me
Rick: Morty, get over here! I've got a new adventure for us.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. What's the adventure this time?

Rick: We're going to fight Batman, Morty. The Dark Knight himself!

Morty: Whoa, really? Is that even possible?

Rick: Anything is possible, Morty. Especially when you have a portal gun and a brilliant mind like mine.

Morty: But why would we want to fight Batman? He's a good guy!

Rick: Good guy, schmood guy. He's just another vigilante in a cape. I want to see if we can take him down.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: I don't know, Rick. He's got all those gadgets and training.

Rick: Morty, gadgets and training mean nothing when you have the power of science on your side. We'll outsmart him!

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Okay, Rick. How do we even find Batman?

Rick: Easy, Morty. We just need to create a portal to Gotham City. He'll come running.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Alright, let's do this. But if Batman kicks our butts, it's on you.

Rick: Don't worry, Morty. We've faced worse. Now, let's go!

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Gotham City]

Rick: Frick, Morty. Look at this place. It's like a dark and brooding nightmare.

Morty: Yeah, it's pretty creepy, Rick. I hope we don't run into any villains.

Rick: Relax, Morty. We're the ones causing chaos today. Now, let's find Batman.

[Rick and Morty spot Batman in the distance]

Rick: There he is, Morty. The Bat himself.

Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. He looks tough.

Rick: Tough, schmough. We'll show him what we're made of. Let's do this!

[Rick and Morty approach Batman]

Rick: Hey, Batsy! Ready to get your butt kicked?

Batman: Who are you two? Criminals?

Morty: No, we're just a couple of guys who want to see if we can take you down.

Batman: You're making a big mistake, boys.

Rick: We'll see about that. Morty, attack!

[Morty tries to punch Batman, but Batman easily dodges]

Morty: Uh, uh, I can't hit him, Rick!

Rick: Frick, Morty. He's fast. We need a plan.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: What do we do, Rick? He's too good!

Rick: We need to outsmart him, Morty. Think, think!

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: I've got an idea, Rick. We can use the portal gun to create distractions and confuse him.

Rick: Shoot, Morty. That's actually a good plan. Let's give it a try.

[Rick and Morty start creating portals all around Batman]

Batman: What is this? Where are you?

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]

Rick: Crap, Morty. That was intense.

Morty: Yeah, but we did it, Rick. We outsmarted Batman!

Rick: That's right, Morty. We showed him who's the real genius here.

Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I can't believe we actually fought Batman.

Rick: Well, Morty, that's just another day in the life of Rick and Morty. Wubba lubba dub dub!

Morty: Yeah, I guess you're right, Rick. Adventure awaits us, even if it means fighting superheroes.

Rick: Exactly, Morty. Now, let's go grab a slice of interdimensional pizza. I'm starving.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Pizza sounds good, Rick. Maybe we can find a dimension where it's always pizza time.

Rick: Now you're thinking, Morty. Let's go!

[Rick and Morty enter the portal to find the perfect pizza dimension]
