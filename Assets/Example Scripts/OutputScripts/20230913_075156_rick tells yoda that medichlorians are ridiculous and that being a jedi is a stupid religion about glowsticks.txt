Narrator: rick tells yoda that medichlorians are ridiculous and that being a jedi is a stupid religion about glowsticks
Narrator: Prompt By: Dylan Silker
Rick: Morty, I've been thinking.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, uh, what is it now, Rick?
Rick: We need to have a chat with Yoda, Morty.
Morty: Yoda? The little green guy from Star Wars?
Rick: The very same, Morty. The whole Jedi thing is frickin' ridiculous.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I don't know, Rick. The Force seems pretty cool to me.
Rick: The Force? More like a bunch of hokey religions and ancient weapons, Morty.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: But what about the lightsabers, Rick? They're pretty cool, right?
Rick: Glowsticks, Morty. They're just fancy glowsticks.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Starwars Cantina]
Yoda: Hmm, felt a disturbance in the Force, I did. Rick and Morty, it is.
Rick: Yoda, we need to talk.
[Yoda walks to Rick]
Yoda: Speak, you may. Listen, I will.
Rick: This whole Jedi thing - it's crap, Yoda. Just a bunch of mumbo jumbo about midichlorians and glowsticks.
Yoda: Deep, the Force runs. More than science, it is.
Rick: Science is real, Yoda. Your Force is just a bunch of mystical shoot.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. You can't just tell Yoda the Force isn't real.
Rick: Why not, Morty? It's about time someone did.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Well, uh, I mean, it's just... it's a big part of his life, Rick.
Rick: And it's a big part of why the galaxy is in such a mess, Morty.
[Rick walks to Yoda]
Rick: Listen, Yoda. Your Jedi mind tricks and glowsticks aren't going to save the universe. Science is.
Yoda: Perspective, this is. Agree, I do not. But respect, I must.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Yoda. That's all I ask.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: See Morty, even Yoda respects science.
Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. But I still think lightsabers are cool.
Rick: Well, Morty, you're entitled to your wrong opinion.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. You really know how to ruin a guy's day.
Rick: It's what I do best, Morty. It's what I do best.
