Narrator: The narrator tells Morty to do terrible things and Rick goes to Yoda to get an exorcism
Narrator: Prompt By: Rickwhy
Rick: Hey, Morty, we've got a problem here, buddy.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, what is it, Rick? 
Rick: It seems like some kind of interdimensional narrator is making you do terrible things, Morty. 
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, that sounds pretty bad. 
Rick: Yeah, it's not great, Morty. But don't worry, I've got a plan. 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, what's the plan, Rick?
Rick: We're going to see an old friend of mine. He's a bit... green.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Starwars Cantina]
Rick: Yoda, we need your help.
Yoda: Hmm, Rick, it has been a long time.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, who's this guy, Rick?
Rick: This is Yoda, Morty. He's going to help us out.
Yoda: Help, I will. But first, a test you must pass.
Rick: Shoot, Yoda, we don't have time for this crap!
Yoda: Time, there always is. Test, you must pass.
[Rick walks to Center Stage]
Rick: Alright, Yoda. What's the test?
Yoda: Answer this question, you must. What is the meaning of life?
Morty: Uh, is it 42?
Yoda: Correct, you are. Help you, I will.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, I'm scared.
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. Yoda's the best in the business.
Yoda: Begin, the exorcism will. 
[Rick walks to Morty]
Rick: Hold on, Morty. This might get a little weird.
Yoda: Exorcised, the narrator is. Free, Morty is. 
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! You're free!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, that was intense.
Rick: Yeah, but we got through it, Morty. We always do.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Now, let's get back to our regular shenanigans, Morty. No more narrators for you.
Morty: Yeah, Rick. I think I've had enough of that.
