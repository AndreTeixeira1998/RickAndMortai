Narrator: Prompt By: babo 2
Rick: Morty, I've got an idea.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, yeah, Rick? What is it?
Rick: How about we visit a universe where history took a different turn? 
Morty: Uh, what kind of different turn, Rick?
Rick: How about a universe where Hitler won World War II?
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, that sounds frickin' scary. Are you sure it's a good idea?
Rick: Of course it's a good idea, Morty. It's always good to learn from history, even alternate history.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Alright, Rick, if you say so.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Let's go!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to a universe where Hitler won]
Morty: Whoa, everything is German here, Rick. 
Rick: Yep, Morty. Welcome to the German universe.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: This is so weird, Rick. Everyone is speaking German.
Rick: Well, Morty, that's what happens when history takes a different turn.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Do you think they have good beer here, Rick?
Rick: Only one way to find out, Morty. Let's go grab a pint.
Morty: Shoot, Rick, I'm underage.
Rick: Not in this universe, Morty. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. This is all so confusing. 
Rick: Well, Morty, that's the beauty of the multiverse. Every universe is unique in its own way.
Morty: Yeah, I guess so, Rick. But it's still frickin' weird.
Rick: Well, Morty, life is weird. Now, let's go grab that beer.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Okay, Rick. But if anything weird happens, I'm blaming you.
Rick: Fair enough, Morty. Now, let's go!
[Rick and Morty enter a German pub]
Morty: This is so cool, Rick. The beer is really good.
Rick: Told you, Morty. Now, let's get back home before things get too weird.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Morty: That was a crazy adventure, Rick. But I'm glad we're back home.
Rick: Me too, Morty. Now, let's get some rest. We've got more adventures to go on tomorrow.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Can't we just take a break for once?
Rick: No can do, Morty. The multiverse waits for no one. Wubba lubba dub dub!
