Narrator: Rick and morty talk to batman
Narrator: Prompt By: me
Rick: Morty, get over here! We've got a visitor!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, who's here now?
Rick: It's Batman, Morty. The Dark Knight himself!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Holy crap, Rick! Batman is in our garage?
Rick: That's right, Morty. He's here to ask for our help with a case.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Help? Us? What could we possibly do for Batman?
Rick: Well, Morty, it seems there's a new villain in Gotham City who's been causing some trouble. Batman needs our scientific expertise to track him down.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Whoa, Rick, that's frickin' awesome! We're gonna be like Batman's sidekicks!
Rick: Slow down, Morty. We're not sidekicks. We're just lending a hand. Now let's go talk to Batman and see what he needs.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Gotham City]
Rick: Hey, Batman! What's the problem?
[Morty walks to Batman]
Batman: Rick, Morty, I'm glad you're here. We have a new villain in town, and he's causing chaos with his mind-altering technology.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Mind-altering technology? That sounds dangerous, Batman.
Batman: It is, Morty. This villain, known as the Mindbender, has the ability to control people's thoughts and actions. I need your help to neutralize his device and stop him.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: We'll do our best, Batman. But what's in it for us?
Batman: I can offer you access to my high-tech Batcave and any gadgets you may need. Plus, you'll have the satisfaction of saving Gotham City.
[Morty walks to Batman]
Morty: Alright, Batman, we're in. Let's catch this Mindbender and kick his butt!
Batman: Thank you, Morty. I knew I could count on you. Now, let's get to work.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Batcave]
Rick: Alright, Morty, let's analyze this mind-altering device and see if we can reverse-engineer it.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Rick, this technology is insane. It's like something out of a sci-fi movie.
Rick: That's because it is, Morty. The Mindbender is using advanced alien tech. We'll need to use our own scientific genius to outsmart him.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: I'm on it, Rick. I'll start running simulations and see if we can find a vulnerability in the device.
[Rick walks to Morty]
Rick: Good job, Morty. While you do that, I'll work on creating a countermeasure to block the mind control.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Sounds like a plan, Rick. Let's show this Mindbender who's boss.
Rick: You got it, Morty. We're gonna save Gotham City and prove that science beats mind control any day.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Wubba lubba dub dub, Rick! Let's kick some Mindbender butt!
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty. Now, let's get to work and show Batman what we're capable of.
