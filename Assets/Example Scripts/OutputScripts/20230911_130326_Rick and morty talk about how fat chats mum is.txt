Narrator: Rick and morty talk about how fat chats mum is
Narrator: Prompt By: me
Rick: Morty, come over here for a minute. I've got something important to discuss with you.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Uh, what's up, Rick? What's so important that you had to call me over?

Rick: Morty, have you noticed how fat your mom has gotten lately?

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Rick, that's not cool, man. You can't just go around calling people fat.

Rick: Relax, Morty. I'm not trying to be mean or anything. I'm just making an observation. Your mom's put on a few pounds, that's all.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Well, even if that's true, it's not something we should be talking about. It's hurtful.

Rick: Morty, Morty, Morty. Lighten up, buddy. We're just having a conversation here. No need to get all sensitive.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: It's not about being sensitive, Rick. It's about being respectful. We should treat people with kindness, no matter what.

Rick: Shoot, Morty, you're starting to sound like your dad. Always preaching about being politically correct and all that crap.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Well, maybe there's something to be said for being considerate, Rick. It's not cool to make fun of someone's appearance.

Rick: Look, Morty, I get it. But sometimes, we just need to call things as we see them. Your mom's gained weight, and that's a fact.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Yeah, well, maybe we should focus on more important things, like going on adventures and saving the universe.

Rick: Adventures and saving the universe, Morty? That's all well and good, but sometimes we need to address the elephant in the room. Or in this case, your mom's weight.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: I can't believe you're being so insensitive, Rick. You're supposed to be the smart one here.

Rick: Smart, dumb, it's all relative, Morty. But let me tell you something, it's better to be honest than to tiptoe around the truth.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Maybe there's a way to be honest without being hurtful, Rick. We can find a middle ground.

Rick: Middle ground, Morty? That's for people who can't make up their minds. I say let's call it like we see it, no sugar-coating.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: Well, I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree on this one, Rick. Let's focus on the important stuff, like saving the universe.

Rick: Fine, Morty. Have it your way. But mark my words, the truth always finds a way to come out, even if it hurts.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Yeah, well, sometimes the truth can be a double-edged sword, Rick. We have to be careful how we wield it.

Rick: You're starting to sound like a philosopher, Morty. Just remember, sometimes the truth hurts, but it's necessary for growth.

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: I'll keep that in mind, Rick. But let's try to be a little more considerate in the future. We can still be honest without being hurtful.

Rick: Fair enough, Morty. I'll try to find a balance between truth and tact. But no promises, because sometimes the truth can't be sugar-coated.

[Morty walks to Workbench]

Morty: As long as we're making an effort, Rick. That's all I ask for. Let's focus on the important things and leave the fat-shaming behind.

Rick: Agreed, Morty. Let's go out there and have some mind-bending adventures. But remember, the truth is always lurking around the corner.

[Morty walks to Rick]

Morty: Yeah, yeah, I got it, Rick. Truth, adventures, and saving the universe. That's our motto.

Rick: That's the spirit, Morty. Now let's get back to work and find a way to fix that interdimensional portal. We've got a universe to explore!

[Morty walks to Center Stage]

Morty: Right behind you, Rick. But let's try to avoid any unnecessary fat-shaming along the way, okay?

Rick: Deal, Morty. Deal. Let's go, my not-so-skinny sidekick!
