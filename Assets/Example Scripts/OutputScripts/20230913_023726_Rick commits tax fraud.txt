Narrator: Rick commits tax fraud
Narrator: Prompt By: bibasik7
Rick: Morty, come over here, I need your help with something.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what is it this time?
Rick: I need you to help me with this paperwork, Morty.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Uh, Rick, these are tax forms. Are you trying to commit tax fraud?
Rick: Maybe. What's it to you, Morty?
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Rick, that's illegal! We could go to jail!
Rick: Relax, Morty. In this universe, tax fraud is as common as jaywalking.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: That doesn't make it right, Rick! I won't help you with this!
Rick: Fine, Morty. I'll do it myself.
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: Frick, these forms are complicated. Maybe I should've paid more attention in school.
[Rick walks to Center Stage]
Rick: Morty, I need your help after all. I can't make heads or tails of these forms.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Aww crap, Rick. I told you I wouldn't help you commit tax fraud!
Rick: Not with the fraud, Morty. I just need you to explain what these forms mean.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Oh, well... uh, I guess that's okay. But only because it's better than you going to jail.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Now, let's get to work.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Okay, Rick. This form is for reporting your income. And this one is for deducting expenses.
Rick: Great, Morty. Now, help me fill these out.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Fine, Rick. But remember, no fraud!
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! Let's get this done.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Shoot, Morty. We forgot to mail these forms.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. We'll have to go back to the garage to get them.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Alright, Morty. Let's mail these forms and be done with it.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Okay, Rick. Let's do this.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! We're done with taxes for another year!
