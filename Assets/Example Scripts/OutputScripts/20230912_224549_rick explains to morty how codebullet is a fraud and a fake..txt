Narrator: rick explains to morty how codebullet is a fraud and a fake.
Narrator: Prompt By: Morris Mansour
Rick: Morty, come here. I need to show you something.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what is it now?
Rick: This, Morty, is CodeBullet. He's a YouTuber, makes videos about coding and stuff.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Rick: He pretends to be this cool, smart guy who knows everything about coding. But guess what?
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, he's uh, r-really a genius?
Rick: No, Morty, that's where you're wrong. He's a fraud! A big, fat, phony!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: W-what? How can you say that, Rick? He seems pretty smart to me.
Rick: That's just it, Morty. He seems smart. But it's all a facade.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Rick: He just recites what he finds on the internet, Morty. He doesn't understand half the crap he's talking about.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: But, uh, Rick, isn't that what most people do? I mean, we can't all be geniuses like you.
Rick: That's not the point, Morty. The point is he's pretending to be something he's not.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: So, what should we do, Rick?
Rick: Well, Morty, we're not going to do anything. It's not our problem.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: So, why did you tell me all this, Rick?
Rick: Because, Morty, I want you to understand that not everything you see on the internet is real.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, that's a pretty heavy lesson.
Rick: Well, Morty, life is full of heavy lessons. Now, let's get back to work.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! Let's create a portal to another dimension using the power of cheese!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Rick: Well, Morty, here we are. Shrek's Swamp.
Morty: Uh, Rick, why are we here?
Rick: Because, Morty, I felt like visiting an old friend. Now, come on. Let's go say hi to Shrek.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. This is so weird.
Rick: Welcome to our lives, Morty. Now, come on. Let's go.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. We'll be back home in no time. Now, let's get out of here.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well, Morty, what did you learn today?
Morty: I learned that not everything on the internet is real, and that Shrek's Swamp is a real place.
Rick: Good, Morty. Remember, always question what you see.
Morty: Yeah, I got it, Rick. Can we just watch TV now?
Rick: Sure, Morty. Let's watch some interdimensional cable.
