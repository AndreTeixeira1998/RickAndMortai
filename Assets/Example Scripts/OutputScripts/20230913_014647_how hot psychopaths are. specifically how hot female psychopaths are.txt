Narrator: Prompt By: Christina Evergreen
Rick: Hey Morty, do you ever think about how hot psychopaths are?
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, uh, what? Hot psychopaths? Rick, that's a frickin' weird thing to say.
Rick: No, Morty, I'm serious. Think about it. Female psychopaths are hot as hell.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I don't think I'm comfortable with this conversation, Rick.
Rick: Oh, come on, Morty! You're telling me you never found a villainess attractive? 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Well, uh, I mean... Harley Quinn is kinda hot, I guess. 
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! You're getting it. 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: But, Rick, doesn't that make us, uh, kinda messed up? 
Rick: Morty, we're already messed up. We're interdimensional travelers who've seen some real crap.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, you're right. We are kinda messed up.
Rick: Exactly, Morty. Now, let's go meet some hot psychopaths.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Homer: Woah, who are you guys?
Rick: I'm Rick and this is Morty. We're here to meet some hot psychopaths. 
Bart: Hot psychopaths? That sounds cool!
Marge: Bart, no! That's not appropriate.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well, that didn't go as planned.
Morty: Yeah, Rick. Maybe we should stick to our own dimension.
Rick: Probably a good idea, Morty. Wubba lubba dub dub!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I still can't believe we talked about how hot psychopaths are. 
Rick: Oh, get over it, Morty. It's not like we're the first ones to think it.
