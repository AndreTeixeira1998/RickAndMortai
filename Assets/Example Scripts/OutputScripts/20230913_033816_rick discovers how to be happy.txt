Narrator: rick discovers how to be happy
Narrator: Prompt By: Aida
Rick: Morty, I think I've finally figured it out!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, figured what out, Rick?
Rick: How to be happy, Morty! I've finally figured out how to be happy!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, are you sure about this? I mean, isn't happiness a subjective state of mind?
Rick: Not anymore, Morty! With my new happy serum, I can feel happiness anytime I want!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Happy serum? Rick, isn't that just like, uh, drugs?
Rick: No, Morty, it's not drugs. It's science!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Science, drugs, same difference, Rick. What's the catch?
Rick: No catch, Morty. Just pure, unadulterated joy!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: So, uh, can I try some of this happy serum, Rick?
Rick: Of course, Morty! But first, we need to test it on someone else.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Someone else? You mean like, uh, Jerry?
Rick: Exactly, Morty. Let's go to the yard and test it out on Jerry!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Jerry, we've got something for you to try!
[Jerry walks to Rick]
Jerry: Oh, shoot, Rick. What is it this time?
Rick: Just a little something to make you happy, Jerry!
[Jerry walks to Center Stage]
Jerry: I don't know, Rick. The last time I tried one of your serums, I grew a third arm.
Rick: Don't worry, Jerry. This time, you'll only grow a big, fat smile!
[Jerry walks to Rick]
Jerry: Alright, Rick. I'll give it a shot.
Rick: That's the spirit, Jerry! Bottoms up!
[Jerry drinks the serum]
Jerry: Wow, Rick! I feel... I feel... Happy!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. It actually worked.
Rick: Of course it worked, Morty. I'm a genius. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: So, uh, Rick. Can we go back to the garage now?
Rick: Sure, Morty. But remember, happiness is just a serum away!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: And that, Morty, is how you scientifically achieve happiness.
Morty: Yeah, Rick. But, uh, isn't real happiness about finding joy in the little things in life?
Rick: Morty, you're thinking too much. Just enjoy the ride. Wubba lubba dub dub!
