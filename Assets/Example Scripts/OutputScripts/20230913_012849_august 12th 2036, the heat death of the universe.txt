Narrator: august 12th 2036, the heat death of the universe
Narrator: Prompt By: Gogo Josh
Rick: Morty, get over here! We've got a real problem.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, uh, Rick, what's going on? 
Rick: Morty, it's the heat death of the universe. It's happening!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, re re really? Shoot, Rick, I didn't think it would happen so soon.
Rick: Well, Morty, time isn't as linear as you think. It's more like a big ball of wibbly wobbly, timey wimey stuff.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. What are we gonna do?
Rick: Well, Morty, we're gonna do what we always do. We're going to fix it.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Shrek: Oi, what are you two doing in my swamp?
Rick: Shrek, we need your help. The universe is about to die.
Shrek: Well, that's not my problem. I've got my own universe to worry about.
Morty: But, Shrek, if our universe dies, yours will die too. It's all connected.
Shrek: Oh, crap. What do we need to do?
Rick: We need to reverse the entropy. Donkey, fetch me a bucket of your swamp water.
[Donkey fetches the swamp water]
Rick: Now, Morty, we need to go to the Cantina to get Yoda's help.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Starwars Cantina]
Yoda: Hmm, in danger, the universe is. Help you, I will.
Rick: Great, Yoda. We need your force to reverse the entropy.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: Alright, Morty. Hold the bucket while I mix the force and the swamp water.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! We did it! We reversed the heat death!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. That was close.
Rick: Well, Morty, that's the beauty of the multiverse. There's always another adventure waiting for us.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Yeah, Rick. I guess you're right. What's next?
Rick: Well, Morty, let's take a break for now. We've earned it.
