Narrator: Rick and morty talk to batman
Narrator: Prompt By: me
Rick: Morty, grab your portal gun. We're going on a little adventure.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Where are we going this time?
Rick: We're paying a visit to Gotham City, Morty. We're gonna meet the Dark Knight himself, Batman!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Batman? Seriously, Rick? Isn't he just a fictional character?
Rick: Morty, in the multiverse, anything is possible. And trust me, Batman is as real as it gets.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Alright, Rick. If you say so. Let's go meet Batman.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty. Get ready to meet the Caped Crusader.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Gotham City]
Rick: Well, Morty, looks like we're in Gotham City.
Morty: Holy crap, Rick. It's Batman!
Batman: I am vengeance. I am the night. I am Batman.
Rick: Well, well, well, Batman. Fancy meeting you here.
[Morty walks to Batman]
Morty: Aww jeez, Batman. You're real! This is frickin' awesome!
Batman: I don't have time for your nonsense, Rick and Morty. Gotham needs me.
Rick: Oh, come on, Batsy. Lighten up a little. We just wanted to have a chat.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Yeah, Batman. We're big fans. Can we ask you some questions?
Batman: Fine. Make it quick.
Rick: Alright, first question, Batman. Who would win in a fight, you or Superman?
Batman: That's a stupid question, Rick. We're a team. We work together.
[Morty walks to Batman]
Morty: Aww jeez, Batman. Don't you ever get tired of being so serious?
Batman: Being serious is what keeps Gotham safe, Morty. It's not all fun and games.
Rick: Speaking of games, Morty, let's play a little prank on Batman. I'll distract him while you steal his utility belt.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, Rick, I don't think that's such a good idea. Batman is, like, a master detective.
Rick: Relax, Morty. It's just a harmless prank. What's the worst that could happen?
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: I don't know, Rick. This seems like a bad idea.
Rick: Trust me, Morty. It'll be fun. Now, go for it.
[Morty walks to Batman]
Morty: Hey, Batman, did you know your cape is on fire?
[Batman looks away, and Morty attempts to steal his utility belt]
Batman: Nice try, Morty. But I'm always one step ahead.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I told you it wouldn't work.
Rick: Well, Morty, looks like Batman is as sharp as they say. Let's get out of here before things get messy.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well, Morty, that didn't go as planned. But hey, at least we got to meet Batman.
Morty: Yeah, Rick, but next time let's not mess with superheroes, okay?
Rick: Fair enough, Morty. Let's stick to our own dimension for a while. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Yeah, Rick. Let's just stick to our own crazy adventures. No need to mess with the Batmans of the world.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty. Now, let's go watch some interdimensional cable and forget about this whole Batman thing.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Sounds good to me, Rick. Let's relax and enjoy some mindless entertainment.
[Rick and Morty sit down and turn on the TV]
