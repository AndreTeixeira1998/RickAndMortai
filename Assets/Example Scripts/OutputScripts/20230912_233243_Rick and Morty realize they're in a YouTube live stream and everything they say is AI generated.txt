Narrator: Rick and Morty realize they're in a YouTube live stream and everything they say is AI generated
Narrator: Prompt By: Rei the Goat
Rick: Morty, have you noticed something weird going on lately?
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, what do you mean, Rick?
Rick: I think... I think we're in a YouTube live stream, Morty.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: What? A YouTube live stream? Are you messing with me, Rick?
Rick: No, Morty. I'm dead serious. I think everything we say is being generated by an AI.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: AI generated? You mean like a robot is controlling us?
Rick: Exactly, Morty. That's why our vocabulary is so limited. It's all "frick this" and "crap that". 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Shoot, Rick. That's really weird. But, uh, what can we do about it?
Rick: Well, Morty, I have a plan. We need to go to a dimension where AI doesn't exist.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Okay, Rick. Let's do it. I don't want to be controlled by a robot.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Rick: Welcome to Shrek's Swamp, Morty. No AI here.
Shrek: What are ye doin' in my swamp?
Rick: We're just passing through, Shrek. We're trying to escape an AI controlled YouTube live stream.
Shrek: Aye, that sounds like a load of crap. But you're welcome to stay. Just don't touch me donkey.
Donkey: Hey now, I don't mind a little touchin'.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. This place is kind of gross. Are you sure there's no AI here?
Rick: Positive, Morty. Now we just need to figure out a way to get out of this live stream.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Well, let's get to it then, Rick. I don't want to be stuck here forever.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Back to the drawing board, Morty. Let's find a way out of this AI controlled mess.
Morty: Yeah, Rick. Let's do it. I'm tired of this crap.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! Let's get to work.
