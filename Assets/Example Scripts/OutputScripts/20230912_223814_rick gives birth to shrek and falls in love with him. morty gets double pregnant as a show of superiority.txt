Rick: Trust me, Morty, this one is gonna be fun.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Shrek: What are you doing in my swamp?
Rick: Shrek, we've come to see your beautiful face.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, Rick, why are we here exactly?
Rick: Morty, today is the day I give birth to Shrek.
Morty: You're giving birth to Shrek? How does that even work, Rick?
Rick: It's science, Morty, don't question it.
[Rick walks to Center Stage]
Rick: Shrek, I'm your father now.
Shrek: Well, that's a load of crap.
[Rick walks to Shrek]
Rick: No, it's true. And I've fallen in love with you, son.
Shrek: What? That's messed up, even for you, Rick.
Rick: Don't question our love, Shrek.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Rick, this is really weird. I don't think I can handle this.
Rick: Morty, if I can give birth to Shrek, you can get double pregnant. It's only fair.
Morty: Double pregnant? Aww jeez, Rick, that sounds terrible.
Rick: Trust me, Morty, it's a show of superiority.
Shrek: I don't understand any of this, but I don't like it.
Rick: Shrek, my love, it's okay. We're family now.
Shrek: I'm not okay with this, Rick.
Rick: Well, too bad. You're stuck with us now.
Morty: Rick, I think we should go. This is too much.
Rick: Fine, Morty. We'll go.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well, Morty, that was a successful adventure.
Morty: Successful? Rick, that was a nightmare.
Rick: Well, Morty, you're just going to have to get used to it. Wubba lubba dub dub!
