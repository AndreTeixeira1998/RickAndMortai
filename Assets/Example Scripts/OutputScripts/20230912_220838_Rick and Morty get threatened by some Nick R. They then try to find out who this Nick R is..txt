Narrator: Rick and Morty get threatened by some Nick R. They then try to find out who this Nick R is.
Narrator: Prompt By: Stefan
Rick: Morty, get over here! We've got a problem.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what's going on now?
Rick: We've received a threatening message from someone named Nick R. We need to find out who this guy is and what he wants.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: How do we even do that, Rick? We don't have any information about this Nick R.
Rick: That's where my genius comes in, Morty. We'll use my advanced hacking skills to track him down.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Are you sure this is a good idea, Rick? Hacking is illegal, you know.
Rick: Frick legality, Morty. When someone messes with us, we have to fight fire with fire. Now, help me set up the hacking equipment.
[Rick and Morty walk to Workbench]
Rick: Alright, Morty, let's hack into the system and find out who Nick R really is.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, Rick, I'm not so sure about this. What if we get caught?
Rick: Morty, trust me. I've hacked into interdimensional government systems before. We'll be fine.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Okay, Rick, if you say so. Let's just make sure we cover our tracks.
Rick: Good thinking, Morty. We don't want anyone tracing this back to us.
[Rick and Morty walk to Workbench]
Rick: Alright, Morty, I'm in. Let's see who this Nick R really is.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Did you find anything, Rick?
Rick: Shoot, Morty. It looks like Nick R is a rival scientist from Dimension C-137.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: A rival scientist? What does he want with us?
Rick: I'm not sure, Morty, but it looks like he's trying to steal my portal technology. We can't let that happen.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: What do we do now, Rick? How do we stop him?
Rick: We'll have to confront him, Morty. We can't let this Nick R get away with stealing my inventions.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Alright, Rick, let's go kick some Nick R butt!
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty. Let's teach him a lesson he won't forget.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Alright, Morty, keep your eyes peeled. Nick R could be anywhere.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I hope we're not getting ourselves into more trouble.
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. We're the smartest guys in the multiverse. We can handle anything that comes our way.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. We've faced worse before.
Rick: Damn straight, Morty. Now let's find this Nick R and show him what we're made of.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Alright, Morty, let's get to work. We need to set up traps and surveillance to catch this Nick R in the act.
Morty: Crap, Rick. This is getting intense. I hope we can outsmart him.
Rick: We will, Morty. We always do. Now, let's get to it.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Rick, I think I found something. There's a hidden camera in the garage.
Rick: Nice find, Morty. That must be Nick R's surveillance. Let's disable it and set up our own.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Alright, Rick, I've disabled the camera. What's the plan now?
Rick: We wait, Morty. We wait for Nick R to make his move. And when he does, we'll be ready for him.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I hope this plan works, Rick. I don't want to be in danger anymore.
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. We'll take care of this Nick R once and for all. Just trust me.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Alright, Rick. I trust you. Let's catch this Nick R and show him who's boss.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty. Let's show him what happens when you mess with Rick and Morty!
