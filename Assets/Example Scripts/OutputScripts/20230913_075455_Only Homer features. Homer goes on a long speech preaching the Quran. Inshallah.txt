Narrator: Only Homer features. Homer goes on a long speech preaching the Quran. Inshallah
Narrator: Prompt By: H :c
Rick: Morty, I've got a crazy idea.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what is it this time?
Rick: I think it's time we paid a visit to our old friends, the Simpsons.
Morty: The Simpsons? Rick, are you sure? Last time we were there, things got pretty weird.
Rick: Morty, when have I ever led you astray?
Morty: Uh, like, all the time, Rick. All the time.
Rick: Well, this time will be different, Morty. Trust me.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to SimpsonsHouse]
Homer: Well, well, if it isn't Rick and Morty. Welcome back, fellas.
Rick: Thanks, Homer. We just thought we'd drop by for a visit.
Homer: Good timing. I was just about to delve into the Quran. Would you care to join me?
Morty: The Quran? Uh, sure, Homer. Why not?
Homer: Excellent. Let's begin. "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Praise be to Allah, the Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds..."
Rick: Uh, Homer, I don't mean to interrupt, but uh, why are you reading the Quran?
Homer: Well, Rick, I believe in exploring all kinds of spirituality. Besides, it's a frickin' fascinating read.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I didn't know Homer was so...open-minded.
Rick: Yeah, Morty. It's a crap shoot with these other dimensions. You never know what you're gonna get.
Homer: "...And Allah is the best of providers." There, that's a nice place to stop for today.
Morty: Uh, thanks, Homer. That was...enlightening.
Rick: Yeah, thanks, Homer. We should probably be going now.
Homer: Of course. Safe travels, Rick and Morty. And remember, inshallah.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. That was...different.
Rick: Yeah, Morty. But remember, it's important to respect all beliefs. Even in other dimensions. Wubba lubba dub dub!
Morty: Yeah, Rick. I guess you're right.
