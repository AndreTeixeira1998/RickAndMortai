Narrator: Rick and morty can hear the narrator suddenly
Narrator: Prompt By: ColaGames
Rick: Morty, I've got a new invention I want you to see.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, uh what is it this time, Rick?
Rick: It's a device that lets us hear the narrator, Morty.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Hear the narrator? What the frick does that mean, Rick?
Rick: It means we can hear the voice that's narrating our lives, Morty. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Are you telling me that there's a voice narrating everything we do? That's kinda creepy, Rick.
Rick: Well, Morty, it's not like we have a choice. It's part of our existence.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: So, how does this thing work, Rick?
Rick: Just press this button and we'll be able to hear the narrator.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Alright, Rick, let's give it a shot. 
Narrator: And so, Rick and Morty press the button on the device, allowing them to hear my voice.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. This is really weird.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! Isn't it exciting to hear the voice that's narrating our lives?
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I guess so, Rick. But it's also kind of unsettling.
Rick: Well, Morty, that's the beauty of science. It's always unsettling, but also fascinating.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Yeah, I guess you're right, Rick. But can we turn it off now? It's kinda freaking me out.
Rick: Sure thing, Morty. But remember, there's always more to discover in the universe.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Yeah, yeah, Rick. I get it. Let's just get back to our normal lives.
Rick: Normal lives, Morty? There's no such thing for us. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. You always have to make things complicated, don't you?
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Let's keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
