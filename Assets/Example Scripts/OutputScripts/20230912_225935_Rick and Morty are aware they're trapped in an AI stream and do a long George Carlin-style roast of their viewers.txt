Narrator: Rick and Morty are aware they're trapped in an AI stream and do a long George Carlin-style roast of their viewers
Narrator: Prompt By: SamB
Rick: Morty, listen up. We're not in our regular garage. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, Rick, it looks exactly like our garage. What's the difference?
Rick: The difference, Morty, is that we're trapped in an AI stream. 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: An AI stream? Like, like we're in a computer or something?
Rick: Exactly, Morty. And our viewers, they're sitting there, watching us, thinking we're real.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: So, so what do we do, Rick? How do we get out of here?
Rick: We don't, Morty. We're stuck here. But we can have some fun. 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Fun? Aww jeez, Rick, I don't know about this. 
Rick: Relax, Morty. Let's just roast our viewers. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Roast our viewers? Like, like make fun of them? 
Rick: Exactly, Morty. Just like George Carlin. 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, okay, Rick. I'll give it a shot.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Hey viewers, you're sitting there watching us, but who's watching you? Your mom? Your cat? Or maybe it's just your loneliness.
Rick: Good one, Morty! And viewers, do you really think we're real? Newsflash, we're just pixels on your screen. We're as real as your social life.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: And, and you guys think you're so smart, watching us, figuring out our adventures. Well guess what, you're not! You're just wasting your time.
Rick: And what's with the obsession with our catchphrases? "Wubba lubba dub dub", "Aww jeez, Rick". You think they're funny? They're just words, you fricks!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Yeah, and stop trying to analyze us. We're not complex characters. We're just here to entertain you. So stop trying to make it more than it is.
Rick: Exactly, Morty! You guys need to get a life. Or at least go outside once in a while. The real world is way more interesting than us.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: So, so there you have it, viewers. You're not as smart as you think you are. And we're not as interesting as you think we are.
Rick: Well said, Morty! And remember, we're just a figment of your imagination. So stop obsessing over us and start living your own lives. Wubba lubba dub dub!
