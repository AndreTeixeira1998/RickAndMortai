Narrator: rick and morty roast code bullet's coding
Narrator: Prompt By: Aiden
Rick: Morty, you've got to check this out. This guy, Code Bullet, he's got some interesting stuff going on.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, uh, who's Code Bullet, Rick?
Rick: He's a guy who does coding stuff on the internet, Morty. He's trying to make AI's and stuff. 
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: AI's? Like, like artificial intelligence? That sounds cool, Rick. 
Rick: Yeah, Morty, but the thing is, he's not doing it very well. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Oh, really, Rick? Is it that bad?
Rick: Yeah, Morty. His code is like a piece of Swiss cheese, full of holes. 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. That sounds pretty bad. 
Rick: It is, Morty, it is. But it's also kind of hilarious. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Hilarious, Rick? How can bad coding be hilarious?
Rick: Well, Morty, you see, when you've been doing this as long as I have, you start to find humor in the little things. 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, okay, Rick. If you say so.
Rick: Trust me, Morty. It's a hoot. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Alright, Rick. If you think it's funny, then I guess it's funny.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Now, let's go roast this guy's code. 
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Roast his code, Rick? Like, make fun of it?
Rick: Exactly, Morty. We're going to tear it apart, piece by piece. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. That sounds kind of mean.
Rick: Not mean, Morty, just honest. This guy needs to know his code is crap. 
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Well, if you say so, Rick. I guess we can give it a try.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Alright, Rick. Let's do it.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Now, Morty, let's start with this bit of code here... it's a frickin' mess.
Morty: Uh, okay, Rick. If you say so.
Rick: Trust me, Morty. This is going to be fun.
