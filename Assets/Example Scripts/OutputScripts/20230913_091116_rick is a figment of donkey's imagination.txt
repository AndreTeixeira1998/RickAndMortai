Narrator: Prompt By: Majenko Technologies
Rick: Morty, we're going to Shrek's Swamp. I've heard there's something interesting happening there.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Shrek: Ah, it's you two again. What do you want this time?
Rick: We heard there's something interesting going on here, Shrek.
Shrek: Well, Donkey's been acting a bit strange lately. He keeps talking about some guy named Rick.
Rick: Frick, that's me! What's he been saying?
Shrek: Just rambling about some crazy adventures and science stuff. It's all gibberish to me.
Donkey: Rick! You're here! I've been telling Shrek all about our adventures!
Morty: Uh, Rick, have we met Donkey before?
Rick: No, Morty, we haven't. This is really weird.
Donkey: Rick, you've got to help me. I think I'm going crazy!
Rick: Alright, Donkey, calm down. Let's see what we can do.

[Rick walks to Workbench]
Rick: Morty, hand me that quantum analyser.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: This one, Rick?
Rick: Yes, Morty, that one. Now let's go back and see what's going on with Donkey.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Rick: Donkey, we're going to run some tests.
Donkey: Oh, shoot! I knew it! I'm losing my mind!
Morty: Uh, Rick, what if Donkey's not crazy? What if you're just a figment of his imagination?
Rick: Crap, Morty, that's... actually a good point.
Donkey: Wait, so I'm not crazy?
Rick: No, Donkey, you're not crazy. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
Donkey: Oh, that's a relief! Thanks, Rick! 
Rick: No problem, Donkey. Now, let's go home, Morty. Wubba lubba dub dub!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, that was a close one.
Rick: Yeah, Morty, but we made it. We always do.
