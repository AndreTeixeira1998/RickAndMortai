Narrator: Rick and morty talk to batman
Narrator: Prompt By: me
Rick: Morty, I've just got word from a rather... unusual source. 
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Oh, great, Rick. Who is it this time? Some weird alien or a talking banana or something?
Rick: No, Morty, this time it's Batman.
Morty: Batman? Like, the Batman? The superhero?
Rick: That's the one, Morty. Apparently, he's having some sort of problem.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Wait, Batman needs our help? That's... that's insane, Rick! 
Rick: Yeah, well, the multiverse is a crazy place, Morty. 
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to Batman's Batcave]
Batman: Rick, Morty, thank you for coming. 
Morty: Holy crap, Rick! It's actually Batman!
Rick: Keep it together, Morty. What's the issue, Bats?
Batman: It's the Joker. He's stolen my Batmobile.
Rick: Frick, not the Batmobile! That thing's a classic!
Morty: Shoot, Batman, that's... that's really bad. What can we do?
Batman: I need you two to help me get it back. 
[Rick walks to Center Stage]
Rick: Alright, Batman. We'll help. But we're doing it our way.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Joker's Hideout]
Morty: Uh, Rick, are we sure about this? The Joker's really dangerous.
Rick: Relax, Morty. We've dealt with worse. 
Joker: Well, if it isn't Batman's little helpers. 
Rick: Give up the Batmobile, Joker. Or else.
Joker: Or else what?
Rick: Or else we'll... we'll... frick, Morty, what's something scary?
Morty: Uh, we'll... we'll suck your brains out through your nose!
Joker: Hah! You're funny. But not as funny as Batman's face when he sees his precious Batmobile in pieces!
Rick: That's it, Joker. You asked for it.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Morty, grab the Quantum Discombobulator.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: This one, Rick?
Rick: That's the one, Morty. Now, let's go save the Batmobile.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Joker's Hideout]
Rick: Say goodbye to your plans, Joker!
[Rick uses the Quantum Discombobulator on the Joker]
Joker: What the-?!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Batcave]
Batman: You did it. The Batmobile is safe. Thank you.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. We just saved Batman's car.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! Now, let's get out of here before Batman tries to make us sidekicks or something.
