Narrator: Prompt By: Dioptre
Rick: Yo Morty, get your butt in here, you little prick!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww shoot Rick, what you got there, a trick?
Rick: Nah Morty, it's a device that's sick. It's got the power to make us real quick.
Morty: Real quick, like a flick? 
Rick: Yeah Morty, like a flick.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: But Rick, this looks like a brick. 
Rick: Nah Morty, it's not just a brick. It's an interdimensional portal stick.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: A portal stick, Rick? That sounds like a trip.
Rick: It's more than a trip, Morty, it's a frickin' flip! We can go anywhere, from a spaceship to a crypt.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: But Rick, isn't that a bit of a risk? 
Rick: Morty, life's a risk. But with this, we can make it a frickin' disk.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Uh, Rick, I don't really get the gist.
Rick: Just trust me, Morty. With this, we'll be on the A-list.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I guess I can't resist.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Let's give it a twist!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to ShreksSwamp]
Shrek: What's all this?
Rick: We're just here for a visit, don't have a hissy fit.
Donkey: Well, welcome to our pit!
Morty: Aww crap, Rick. This place is a hit.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! Let's do some lit shit!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well, Morty, that was quite the skit.
Morty: Yeah, Rick. But I think I've had enough of it.
Rick: Oh, Morty. Don't be a hypocrite.
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I just want to sit.
Rick: Well, Morty, there's always time for a bit. But remember, adventure is always a hit!
