Narrator: Rick says the n word while Morty tries to stop him
Narrator: Prompt By: Scalar
Rick: Morty, I need your help with something.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh uh, what is it Rick?
Rick: I've been trying to decipher this alien language, Morty. There's this one word I can't quite get.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Let me see, Rick. Maybe I can help.
Rick: It's this word here, Morty. It's a tricky one.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Uh, Rick, that word looks awfully similar to a very offensive word in our language.
Rick: What? No way, Morty. It's just an alien word. 
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Rick, I really think you should avoid saying that word. It could be misinterpreted.
Rick: Misinterpreted? Morty, we're in a garage in the middle of nowhere. Who's gonna hear me?
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Still, Rick. It's not right. We should respect all cultures.
Rick: Morty, you're missing the point. This isn't about offending anyone. It's about understanding an alien language.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I get that, Rick. But there's got to be another way to learn this language without risking offending anyone.
Rick: Morty, you're overthinking this. Let's just continue with our research.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Fine, Rick. But I'm warning you, if you say that word, there will be consequences.
Rick: Consequences? Morty, the only consequence here is your lack of understanding of the importance of linguistic research.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I just don't want any trouble, okay?
Rick: Trouble? Morty, we're already in trouble just by existing in this multiverse.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: I guess you're right, Rick. But still, let's try to be respectful.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! You're such a worrywart.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: I'm just trying to do what's right, Rick.
Rick: And that's why you're my favorite grandson, Morty.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww, thanks Rick. I guess.

Note: A scenario where Rick actually says the n-word would not be appropriate for the show and is not included in this script.
