Narrator: Rick is obsessed with the Chinese word 那個 and decides to repeat it constantly
Narrator: Prompt By: chan Anson
Rick: Morty, get over here! I've discovered something mind-blowing!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what is it this time?
Rick: Morty, you won't believe it. I've stumbled upon the most fascinating word in the multiverse. It's called 那個.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: 那個? What the heck does that mean, Rick?
Rick: Well, Morty, 那個 is a Chinese word that can be used in a multitude of situations. It's like a linguistic Swiss Army knife.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Uh, Rick, that's great and all, but why are you so obsessed with this word?
Rick: Morty, 那個 is the ultimate expression of ambiguity. It can mean "that one," "um," "uh," or even "uhh," all at the same time. It's a linguistic masterpiece!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Okay, Rick, but can we get back to our regular adventures now?
Rick: Morty, you don't understand the power of 那個. It's a universal phrase that transcends dimensions. I'm gonna start using it in every conversation.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Shoot, Rick. You're gonna drive everyone crazy with that word.
Rick: Oh, crap, Morty. You don't think I can handle it? Watch this: 那個, Morty. 那個.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Uh, Rick, maybe you should take it easy. You're starting to sound like a broken record.
Rick: Broken record? More like a linguistic virtuoso, Morty. 那個, 那個, 那個.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Fine, Rick. If you wanna keep saying 那個, go ahead. Just don't come crying to me when nobody understands you.
Rick: Don't worry, Morty. The beauty of 那個 is that it's open to interpretation. It's a conversation starter, a mind-bender, a linguistic enigma.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Alright, Rick. If you say so. Just remember, I warned you about the consequences of your 那個 obsession.
Rick: Consequences? Morty, there are no consequences when you're a genius like me. 那個!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Yeah, yeah, Rick. Whatever you say. Just don't be surprised if people start avoiding you because of your excessive 那個-ing.
Rick: Morty, I don't need people. I have 那個. It's my new best friend, my linguistic companion, my everything!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Alright, Rick. If you're happy with your 那個, then I guess I'll just have to deal with it.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! Embrace the power of 那個! Let's go explore the multiverse while shouting 那個 at the top of our lungs!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: 那個! We're outside, Morty! The perfect place to spread the gospel of 那個!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I can't believe I'm stuck in this 那個 madness.
Rick: Morty, embrace the 那個! Let it guide you to new dimensions, new adventures, and new meanings!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Alright, Rick. If this is what it takes to make you happy, then let's embrace the 那個 together.
Rick: That's the spirit, Morty! We're gonna conquer the multiverse, one 那個 at a time!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Back in the Garage, Morty. Our home base for 那個-ing to the max!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Can't we just have a normal day for once?
Rick: Morty, there's no such thing as normal when you're a genius like me. Now, let's continue our 那個 adventure!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Alright, Rick. Let's dive deep into the 那個 abyss. But remember, I'm not responsible for the consequences.
Rick: Consequences, Morty? With 那個 by our side, there are no consequences. Now, let's go and 那個 the world!
