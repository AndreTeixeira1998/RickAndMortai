Hello welcome to my hell.
ahh so yeah have a look around.
I'm not gonna pay for you to play around with this so youre gonna need ur own api keys and stuff.
you neeed....
Chatgpt api key.
Fake you username and password.

these are to be stored in your computers environment variables 
to add them go windows > search environmen variables > then click the button at the bottom that says Evironment Variabels...

make sure theyre user variables not system variables.
then add your keys with these names

OPENAI_API_KEY
FAKE_YOU_USERNAME_OR_EMAIL
FAKE_YOU_PASSWORD

and hit run and magic, i guess.
if you wanna do your own unique prompt, in the WholeThingManager code on line 93ish theres a line to change, not the sexiest way of doing that but fuck you i do what i want.

ooh also if you want to stream it. then you need to run the python script. its probably called YoutubeChatReader or something.
change the video_id="R89BVA6sios" to be the video id of the stream. 
also youll need to enable youtube chat by setting the usingYoutubeChatStuff to true in the youtube chat manager in the inspector.
Also if you want to speed it up a bunch you will probably wanna get some proxy servers. I used webshare and bought like 250 poxies for like $10 a month or somthing 
paste them into the "Webshare 250 proxies.txt" file and that should speed that bitch up 
each line should look something like this: 150.207.112.359:6596:lfdsqjwe:1pq2jsl74n2g
that is just random numbers and shit dont try to use that one. 
Be warned shit will take ages without proxies, and a lot of the tts stuff will fail and the characters will be like eieieieieieieiie.
it might actually just not work at all without proxies so i would suggest getting that.
theres a toggle for turning using voice acting on the whole thing manager if you cant get that to work.
